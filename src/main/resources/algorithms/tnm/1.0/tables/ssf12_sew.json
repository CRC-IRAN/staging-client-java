If specific information is available about some but not all of the high risk features, count the number of features documented in the record.\n\nPoorly differentiated/Undifferentiated (grade 3 or 4)\nDepth greater than 2 millimeter (mm) thickness \nClark level IV or V\nPerineural invasion\nPrimary site: skin of external ear (C44.2) OR skin of lip (hair-bearing, also called non-glabrous lip) (C44.0)\n\n**Note 3:**  Use codes 991, 992, and 993 only if no specific information is available about the high risk features (other than primary site), but the record contains a general statement about the presence of high risk features.",
