  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:**  Bilateral nodes are considered regional nodes for tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Clinical assessment of bilateral regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed.\n\n**Note 3:**  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins.  Secondary basins are considered regional for TNM staging. \n\n**Note 4:**  In transit metastasis is defined as a tumor distinct from the primary lesion and located either between the primary lesion and the draining regional lymph nodes or distal to the primary lesion. In transit metastasis is coded in regional lymph nodes.\n\n**Note 5:**  Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) should be considered positive nodes. If only ITCs are present, defined as any tumor deposits in lymph nodes less than or equal to 0.2 mm, use code 010. \n\n**Note 6:**  Regional lymph nodes for scrotum\n\n    Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) only\n\n    Regional lymph nodes (unilateral or bilateral):\n    Iliac, NOS:\n        External\n        Internal (hypogastric), NOS:\n            Obturator\n    Inguinal, NOS:\n        Deep inguinal, NOS:\n            Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n        Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n    Pelvic nodes in contiguous or secondary nodal basin\n\n    Regional lymph node(s), NOS",
