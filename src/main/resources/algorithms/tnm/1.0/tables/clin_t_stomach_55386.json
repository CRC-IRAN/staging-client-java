  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Intraluminal or intramural extension to esophagus and duodenum is classified by the depth of greatest invasion in any of these sites, including stomach.  (For extension to esophagus or duodenum via serosa, assign T4b).\n\n**Note 2:**  If the diagnosis states linitis plastica and no other information regarding extension is available, assign T2.  Linitis plastica is defined as diffuse involvement of the entire thickness of the stomach wall.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor that extends into gastrocolic or gastrohepatic ligaments or into greater or lesser omentum, without perforation of visceral peritoneum, is T3.\n\n**Note 4:**   Assign T4b for contiguous extension from the site of origin. Discontinuous involvement is coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 5:**  Adjacent structures of the stomach are the spleen, transverse colon, liver, diaphragm, pancreas, abdominal wall, adrenal gland, kidney, small intestine, and retroperitoneum. Involvement of these through contiguous extension are assigned T4b.",
