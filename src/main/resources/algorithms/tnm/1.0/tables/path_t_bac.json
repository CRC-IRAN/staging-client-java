Trabecular, cancellous, or spongy bone (spongiosa) is a porous network of tissue filling the interior of bone, decreasing weight and allowing room for blood vessels and marrow.\n\n**Note 2:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size when involvement is limited to the cortical bone. Involvement through cortical bone is required for assignment of T4a. \n\n    Invasive tumor on one side confined to:\n        Lamina propria\n        Submucosa\n\n     Midline tumor\n     Tumor crosses midline\n\n     Base of tongue\n     Bone, NOS\n     Cortical bone of mandible\n     Cortical bone of maxilla\n     Cortical bone, NOS\n     Floor of mouth\n     Gingiva, lower\n     Mandible, NOS\n     Maxilla, NOS\n     Retromolar trigone\n     Sublingual gland \n\n     Localized, NOS",
