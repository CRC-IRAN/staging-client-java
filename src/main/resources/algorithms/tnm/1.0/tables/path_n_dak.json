  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Histological examination of a regional lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 16 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0.\n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional lymph nodes and lymph nodes, NOS in this field.  Distant lymph nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 3:** Assign N1 if regional lymph nodes are involved but there is no indication of the number of nodes involved.\n\n**Note 4:**  Metastatic nodules in the fat adjacent to a gastric carcinoma, without evidence of residual lymph node tissue, are considered regional node metastases, but nodules implanted on peritoneal surfaces are considered distant metastases.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes for Stomach are:**\n\n    Celiac:\n       Hepatic (excluding gastrohepatic) \n       Hepatoduodenal     \n    Left gastric (superior gastric), NOS:\n       Cardial\n       Cardioesophageal\n       Gastric, left\n       Gastropancreatic, left\n       Lesser curvature\n       Lesser omental\n       Paracardial\n    Hepatoduodenal (for lesser curvature)  \n    Nodule(s) in perigastric fat    \n    Pancreaticosplenic (pancreaticolienal)\n    Pancreaticoduodenal\n    Perigastric, NOS\n    Peripancreatic\n    Right gastric (inferior gastric), NOS:\n       Gastrocolic\n       Gastroduodenal\n       Gastroepiploic (gastro-omental), right or NOS\n       Gastrohepatic\n       Greater curvature\n       Greater omental\n       Pyloric, NOS: infrapyloric, subpyloric, suprapyloric\n    Splenic (lienal), NOS:\n        Gastroepiploic (gastro-omental), left\n        Splenic hilar\n  \n    Regional lymph nodes, NOS\n    Lymph nodes, NOS",
