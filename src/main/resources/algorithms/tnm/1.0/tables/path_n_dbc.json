If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (1)\n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 3:** FIGO Stage IIIB is assigned based on primary tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement. If it is unknown whether it is based on extension or regional lymph node involvement, assign to N (regional lymph nodes).  \n\n**Note 4:**  If either exploratory or definitive surgery is done with no mention of lymph nodes, assume nodes are negative.\n\n**Note 5:**  If the clinician says \"adnexa palpated\" but does not mention lymph nodes, assume lymph nodes are not involved.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes:**\n\n    Iliac, NOS:\n       Common\n       External\n       Internal (hypogastric)\n           Obturator\n    Paracervical\n    Parametrial\n    Pelvic, NOS\n    Sacral, NOS:\n       Lateral (laterosacral)\n       Middle (promontorial) (Gerota's node)\n       Presacral\n       Uterosacral\n\n    Regional lymph nodes, NOS\n    Lymph nodes, NOS",
