Superior mesenteric nodes are coded in distant metastasis for all colon sites.  Mesenteric node(s), NOS are coded in regional lymph nodes (N).\n\n**Note 3:** Regional lymph node involvement is rare for GISTs, so that cases in which the nodal status is not associated clinically or pathologically could be considered N0 instead of cNX or pNX.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes for colon**\n \n**All colon sites** \n\n    Colic [NOS] \n    Epicolic (adjacent to bowel wall) \n    Mesocolic [NOS] \n    Mesenteric [NOS]\n    Paracolic/pericolic\n\n**Cecum (C180)** \n\n    Anterior (prececal) \n    Cecal [NOS]\n    Ileocolic\n    Periappendiceal\n    Posterior (retrocecal)\n    Right colic \n\n**Ascending colon (C182)** \n\n    Ileocolic\n    Middle colic\n    Right colic\n\n**Hepatic flexure (C183)** \n\n    Middle colic \n    Right colic\n\n**Transverse colon (C184)** \n\n    Inferior mesenteric \n    Left colic \n    Middle colic \n    Right colic\n\n**Splenic flexure (C185)** \n\n    Inferior mesenteric \n    Left colic \n    Middle colic\n\n**Descending colon (C186)** \n\n    Inferior mesenteric \n    Left colic \n    Sigmoid \n\n**Sigmoid colon (C187)** \n\n    Inferior mesenteric \n    Left colic \n    Rectosigmoid \n    Sigmoid \n    Sigmoidal (sigmoid mesenteric) \n    Superior hemorrhoidal \n    Superior rectal",
