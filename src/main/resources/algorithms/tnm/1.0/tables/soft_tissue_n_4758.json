  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis. \n\n**Note 2:**  Regional lymph nodes are defined as those in the vicinity of the primary tumor.\n\n**Note 3:**  Regional lymph node involvement is rare.  For this schema, if there is no mention of lymph node involvement clinically, assume that lymph nodes are negative.  Assign NX only when there is no available information on the extent of the patient's disease, for example when a lab-only case is abstracted from a biopsy report and no clinical history is available.\n\n**Note 4:**  For head, neck, and trunk primaries only, regional lymph nodes include bilateral or contralateral nodes.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes by primary site:**\n\n**Head and Neck subsites:**\n\n    Cervical\n    Lip:\n       Facial, NOS:\n           Buccinator (buccal)\n           Nasolabial\n       Mandibular\n           Submandibular (submaxillary)\n           Submental\n       Parotid, NOS:\n           Infra-auricular\n           Preauricular\n    Eyelid/canthus:\n        Facial, NOS:\n            Buccinator (buccal)\n            Nasolabial\n        Mandibular:\n            Submandibular (submaxillary)\n            Submental\n        Parotid, NOS:\n            Infra-auricular\n    External ear and auditory canal:\n        Mastoid (posterior, retro-auricular) (occipital)\n        Preauricular\n    Face, Other (cheek, chin, forehead, jaw, nose, and temple):\n        Facial, NOS:\n            Buccinator (buccal)\n            Nasolabial\n        Mandibular:\n            Submandibular (submaxillary)\n            Submental\n        Parotid, NOS:\n            Infra-auricular\n            Preauricular\n    Scalp:\n        Mastoid (posterior, retro-auricular) (occipital)\n        Parotid, NOS:\n            Infra-auricular\n            Preauricular\n            Spinal accessory (posterior cervical)\n    Neck:\n        Axillary\n        Mastoid (posterior, retro-auricular) (occipital)\n        Mandibular\n        Parotid, NOS:\n            Infra-auricular\n            Preauricular\n        Spinal accessory (posterior cervical)\n        Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)\n\n**All other subsites:**\n\n    Arm/shoulder:\n       Axillary\n       Spinal accessory for shoulder\n       Epitrochlear for hand/forearm\n    Leg/hip:\n       Femoral (superficial inguinal)\n       Popliteal for heel and calf\n    Thorax:\n       Hilar (bronchopulmonary) (proximal lobar) (pulmonary root)\n       Mediastinal\n    Abdomen:\n       Celiac\n       Iliac\n       Para-aortic\n    Pelvis:\n       Deep inguinal, NOS:\n       Rosenmuller or Cloquet node\n       Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n    Upper trunk:\n       Axillary\n       Cervical\n       Internal mammary\n       Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)\n    Lower trunk:\n       Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n    Submental nodes for  neck primary only \n    (Including bilateral or contralateral nodes)",
