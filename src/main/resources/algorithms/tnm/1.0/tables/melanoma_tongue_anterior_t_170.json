Tis is mapped to NA and TNM stage group is derived as NA.\n\n**Note 2:**  Mucosal melanomas are aggressive tumors, therefore T1 and T2 are omitted as are Stages I and II.\n\n**Note 3:**  The intrinsic muscles of tongue are four paired muscles within the tongue which control its shape.  The extrinsic muscles originate from structures outside the tongue and control its positioning.",
