  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS in this field.  Note 2 specifies when to code certain tumor deposits (TD) here.  Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:** Per UICC, \"Tumor deposits (satellites), i.e., macroscopic or microscopic nests or nodules, in the pericolorectal adipose tissue's lymph drainage area of a primary carcinoma without histological evidence of residual lymph node in the nodule, may represent discontinuous spread, venous invasion with extravascular spread (V1/2) or a totally replaced lymph node (N1/2). If such deposits are observed with lesions that would otherwise be classified as T1 or T2, then the T classification is not changed, but the nodule(s) is recorded as N1c. If a nodule is considered by the pathologist to be a totally replaced lymph node (generally having a smooth contour), it should be recorded as a positive lymph node and not as a satellite, and each nodule should be counted separately as a lymph node in the final pN determination.\"\n\n**Note 3:**  Assign N1 if regional lymph nodes are involved but there is no indication of the number of nodes involved.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes for rectosigmoid junction and rectum**\n    \n**All sites:** \n\n    Haemorrhoidal (hemorrhoidal)(middle, superior) \n    Inferior mesenteric \n    Mesenteric [NOS] \n    Perirectal \n    Rectal (middle) \n    Rectal [NOS] \n    Rectal (superior) \n    Rectosigmoid (paracolic/pericolic)\n    Sigmoidal (sigmoid mesenteric)\n\n    Regional lymph nodes, NOS\n    Lymph nodes, NOS\n\n**Rectosigmoid (C19.9)** \n\n    Colic, (NOS) \n    Left colic\n  \n**Rectum (C20.9)** \n\n    Haemorrhoidal (hemorrhoidal) (inferior) \n    Internal iliac (hypogastric)  \n    Lateral (laterosacral) \n    Middle (promontorial) (Gerota's node) \n    Obturator\n    Presacral\n    Rectal (inferior) \n    Sacral (NOS)\n    Sacral promontory",
