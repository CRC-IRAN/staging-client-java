Trabecular, cancellous, or spongy bone (spongiosa) is a porous network of tissue filling the interior of bone, decreasing weight and allowing room for blood vessels and marrow.\n\n**Note 2:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size when involvement is limited to the cortical bone.
