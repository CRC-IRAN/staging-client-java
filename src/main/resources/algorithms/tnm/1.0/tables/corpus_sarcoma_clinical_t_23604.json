Assign 88 and behavior code /2 for in situ tumors.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1a or T1b. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1 category, but no size or category is specified, assign T1,\n\n**Note 4:**  FIGO Stage IV, NOS is assigned based on tumor extension and/or metastasis.  Code primary tumor based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IV, NOS only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension.",
