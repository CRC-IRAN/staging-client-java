  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Histological examination of an inguinal lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes; a pelvic lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (FIGO classifies such cases as pNX). (1)\n\n**Note 2:** Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).  \n\n**Note 3:**  When both the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and regional lymph node detail are available, record the code with regional lymph node detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage. FIGO Stage III is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  \n\n**Regional lymph nodes:**\n\n    Upper two thirds of vagina, regional nodes: \n       Pelvic lymph nodes:\n           Iliac, NOS:\n              Common\n              External\n               Internal (hypogastric)\n                   Obturator\n                   Middle sacral (promontorial) (Gerota's node)\n       Pelvic lymph node(s), NOS\n\n    Lower third of vagina, regional nodes:\n       Ipsilateral or bilateral:\n          Inguinal, NOS:\n             Superficial inguinal (femoral)",
