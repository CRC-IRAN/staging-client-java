FIGO IVA is extension, whereas FIGO IVB is distant metastasis. FIGO Stage III, NOS and FIGO Stage IV, NOS are assigned based on tumor extension and/or metastasis.  Code primary tumor based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage III, NOS or FIGO Stage IV, NOS only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension.\n\n**Note 4:**  Extension to the bowel or bladder mucosa must be proven by biopsy in order to rule out bullous edema.",
