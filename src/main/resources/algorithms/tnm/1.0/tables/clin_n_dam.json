  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:**  Any finding of melanoma in lymph nodes, regardless of size and including isolated tumor cells (ITCs), should be coded as positive lymph nodes in this field.  If only ITCs are present, assign N1.\n\n**Note 3:**  Bilateral or contralateral nodes are considered regional nodes for head, neck, and truncal tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Truncal tumors may also drain to both cephalad and caudal primary nodal basins as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Clinical assessment of bilateral/contralateral or cephalad/caudal regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed. \n\n**Note 4:**  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins.  Secondary basins are considered regional for TNM staging.\n\n**Note 5:**  Satellite lesions/nodules or in-transit metastases are coded in this field. Assign N2c if there are satellite(s) or in-transit metastasis without regional lymph node involvement. Assign N3 if  both satellite nodules/in-transit metastases and regional lymph nodes are present. \n\n**Note 6:**  Regional lymph nodes by skin primary site \n\n     Head and Neck (includes bilateral
