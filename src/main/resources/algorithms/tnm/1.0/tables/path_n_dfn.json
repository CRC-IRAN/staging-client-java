If the regional lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. \n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field. Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis. \n\n**Note 3:**  Celiac nodes are classified as distant nodes for TNM 7 staging.  These nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes:**\n\n    Cystic duct (node of the neck of the gallbladder) (Calot's node)\n    Hepatic artery\n    Hilar (in the hepatoduodenal ligament)\n    Node of the foramen of Winslow (omental) (epiploic)\n    Pancreaticoduodenal:\n        Anterior\n        Posterior\n    Pericholedochal (node along common bile duct)\n    Periduodenal\n    Peripancreatic (near head of pancreas only)\n    Periportal\n    Porta hepatis (portal) (hilar) (in hilus of liver)\n    Superior mesenteric artery\n    Superior mesenteric vein",
