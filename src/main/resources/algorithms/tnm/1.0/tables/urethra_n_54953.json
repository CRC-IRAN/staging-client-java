Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 2:** Regional nodes include bilateral and contralateral involvement of named nodes.\n\n**Note 3**: Size of the largest metastasis in a lymph node must be known to assign N. You may use a physicianâs statement of the N category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the size of the metastasis is not documented, determine the size of the largest involved lymph node as documented pathologically.\n* If the size of the lymph node(s) cannot be determined, assign N1.\n* Do not code the size of any node(s) assigned in M (distant metastasis).",
