  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:** Regional nodes include bilateral and contralateral involvement of named nodes.\n\n**Note 3:** Size of lymph nodes must be known to assign N. You may use a physicianâs statement of the N category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the size of the lymph node(s) is not known, assign N1. \n\n**Note 4:** Determine the size of the largest metastasis in a lymph node as documented in the pathology report to N, not the size of the lymph node itself. If the size of the metastasis is not documented, determine the size of the largest involved lymph node as documented pathologically or clinically with pathology taking priority. Do not code the size of any node(s) coded in distant metastasis.",
