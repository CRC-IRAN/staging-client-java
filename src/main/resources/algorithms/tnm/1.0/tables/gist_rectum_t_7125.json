  "notes" : "**Note 1:** TNM does not include an in situ category for GIST tumors. Assign TX and behavior code /2 for in situ cases.\n\n**Note 2:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon; code depth of invasion or extra-appendiceal spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a T value. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If no tumor size is available, assign TX.\n\n**Note 4:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size.\n\n**All sites**\n\n    Invasive tumor in polyp, NOS\n    Tumor confined to muscular wall\n    Tumor invades through submucosa and muscularis mucosae to involve mucosa\n\n    Extension through  wall, NOS\n    Intraluminal extension to rectosigmoid (rectum only)\n    Intraluminal extension to anus (rectum only)\n    Invasion through muscularis propria or muscularis, NOS\n    Invasion of/through serosa (mesothelium) (visceral peritoneum)\n    Invasion of/through serosa with invasion of/through mucosa\n    Non-peritonealized pericolic tissues invaded\n    Perimuscular tissue invaded\n    Subserosal tissue/(sub)serosal fat invaded\n    Transmural, NOS\n    Wall, NOS\n\n    Confined to rectosigmoid\n    Confined to rectum\n    Localized, NOS\n\n**All sites**\n\n    Adherent to liver capsule\n    Adherent to other organs or structures, NOS\n    Bladder\n    Cul de sac (rectouterine pouch)\n    Fat, NOS\n    Other segments of colon via serosa\n    Ovary(ies)\n    Pelvic wall    \n    Perirectal fat\n    Prostate\n    Skeletal muscles of pelvic floor\n    Uterus\n    Vagina\n      \n**Rectosigmoid (C19.9)**\n\n    Colon via serosa\n    Fallopian tube(s)\n    Mesentery (including mesenteric fat, mesocolon)\n    Pericolic fat\n    Pelvic plexuses\n    Small intestine\n    Ureter(s)\n    \n\n**Rectum (C20.9)**\n\n    Anus (excluding intraluminal extension)\n    Bone(s) of pelvis\n    Colon\n    Ductus deferens\n    Perineum, perianal skin\n    Rectovaginal septum\n    Rectovesical fascia for males only\n    Sacral plexus\n    Sacrum\n    Seminal vesicle(s)\n    Urethra",
