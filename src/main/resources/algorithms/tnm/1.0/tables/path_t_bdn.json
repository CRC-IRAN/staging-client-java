Cortical bone is the dense compact outer layer of the bone. Trabecular, cancellous, or spongy bone (spongiosa) is a porous network of tissue filling the interior of bone, decreasing weight and allowing room for blood vessels and marrow.\n\n**Note 3:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size when involvement is limited to the cortical bone. Involvement through cortical bone is required for assignment of T4a. \n\n    Invasive tumor confined to lamina propria (mucoperiosteum) (stroma)\n\n    Bone, NOS\n    Buccal mucosa (inner cheek)\n    Cartilage of mandible or maxilla\n    Cartilage, NOS\n    Cortical bone of mandible or maxilla\n    Cortical bone, NOS\n    Fascial muscle, NOS\n    Floor of mouth\n    Labial mucosa (inner lip), lower lip\n    Labial mucosa (inner lip), lip, NOS\n    Lateral pharyngeal wall\n    Mandible, NOS\n    Maxilla, NOS\n    Soft palate including uvula\n    Subcutaneous soft tissue of face\n    Tongue mucosa\n    Tonsillar pillars and fossae\n    Tonsils\n \n    Localized, NOS",
