  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The cortex of a bone is the dense outer shell that provides strength to the bone; the spongy center of a bone is the cancellous portion.  The periosteum of the bone is the fibrous membrane covering of a bone that contains the blood vessels and nerves; the periosteum is similar to the capsule on a visceral organ.\n\n**Note 2:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size.\n\n    Adjacent bone/cartilage\n    Invasive tumor confined to cortex of bone\n    Extension beyond cortex to periosteum (No break in periosteum)\n    Extension beyond periosteum to surrounding tissues, including adjacent skeletal muscle(s)\n    Skin\n\n    Further contiguous extension\n\n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 3:**  The term \"skip metastasis\" is not used with a consistent meaning in the literature.  In some cases, it refers to discontinuous metastasis in the same bone as the primary tumor, while in other cases it refers to discontinuous metastasis in an adjacent bone, usually in the same limb.  For TNM staging, discontinuous metastasis in the same bone is classified as T3 , and discontinuous metastasis in an adjacent bone is classified as M1b (coded in distant metastasis).  If a primary bone tumor is stated as having \"skip metastasis\" or \"skip lesions\" with no other information regarding the bone involved, assign T3.",
