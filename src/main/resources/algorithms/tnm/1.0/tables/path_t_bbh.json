  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  When both Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and extension detail are available, record the code with extension detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage. FIGO Stage IIIC is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  Code CS Extension based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIC only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension.\n\n**Note 2:**  FIGO no longer includes a Stage 0 (Tis) for this schema.\n\n**Note 3:**  Liver capsule metastases are coded in CS Extension; liver parenchymal metastases are coded in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 4:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following pelvic organs are considered FIGO Stage II and coded in the range 400-660: adnexa, NOS; bladder, bladder serosa; broad ligament (mesovarium); cul de sac; contralateral fallopian tube; parametrium; pelvic peritoneum; pelvic wall; rectum; sigmoid colon; sigmoid mesentery; ureter; uterus; uterine serosa.\n\n**Note 5:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following abdominal organs are considered FIGO Stage III and coded in the range 685-795: abdominal mesentery; diaphragm; gallbladder; infracolic omentum; kidneys; large intestine except rectum and sigmoid colon; liver (peritoneal surface); omentum; pancreas; pericolic gutter; peritoneum, NOS; small intestine; spleen; stomach; ureters.\n\n**Note 6:**  From the AJCC Manual 7th Edition (page 430):  \"It may be preferable to classify a patient as TX (primary tumor cannot be assessed) if inadequate staging biopsies and/or a lack of peritoneal cytology make it inaccurate to classify the patient with confidence as early stage (Stage T3a/IIIA has not been excluded by adequate staging biopsies).\"\n\n**Note 7:**  Since \"malignant ascites or malignant peritoneal washings\" was not specifically categorized in the 1977 Summary Staging Guide, it is unclear to which stage pre-2001 cases may have been coded.",
