Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) stated to be in situ, noninvasive, or confined to mucosa are classified as Tis.  \"Dysplasia\" alone is generally not reportable in cancer registries but, if a registry does collect it, assign Tis.\n\n**Note 2:**  Intraluminal or intramural extension to esophagus and duodenum is classified by the depth of greatest invasion. For extension to esophagus or duodenum via serosa, assign T4.\n\n**Note 3:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category (T1 or T2) based on the tumor size.\n\n    Invasion into:\n        Lamina propria, including lamina propria in a polyp \n        Muscularis mucosae, including muscularis mucosae in a polyp\n        Submucosa (superficial invasion), including submucosa in a polyp\n\n    Implants inside stomach\n\n    Confined to stomach\n    Localized, NOS",
