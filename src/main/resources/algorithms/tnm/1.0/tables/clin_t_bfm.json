Any cases with a CS Extension code of 000 will derive TX for AJCC 7 staging, though Tis and In Situ will be derived for AJCC 6 staging and Summary Stage.\n\n**Note 3:**  The assignment of T1a and T1b categories for sarcomas of corpus uteri is based on tumor size.\n\n**Note 4:**  FIGO Stage IV, NOS is assigned based on tumor extension and/or metastasis.  Code CS Extension based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IV, NOS only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension.\n\n**Note 5:**  Positive cytology is reported separately (CS Site Specific Factor 2), and is not included as a staging element for AJCC 7 staging.  It is included as a staging element for AJCC 6 and Summary Stage. Since \"cancer cells in ascites or in peritoneal washings\" was not specifically categorized in the 1977 Summary Staging Guide, it is unclear to which stage pre-2001 cases may have been coded in that staging system.",

If it is a CS Version 1 case (CS Version Input Original equals 01XXXX and Year of Diagnosis is before 2010), the T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Extension and pleural cytology status coded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2 as shown in the Extension Cytology AJCC 6 Table CSv1. If it is a CS Version 2 case (CS Version Input Original equals 02XXXX) or Year of Diagnosis is greater than 2009), the T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on the value of CS Extension and pleural cytology status coded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2 as shown in the Extension Cytology AJCC 6 Table CSv2.\n- For CS Extension codes 100-400, 530, and 540 ONLY, the SS77 and SS2000 stages are assigned based on the value of CS Extension and peritoneal cytology status coded in CS Site Specific Factor 2 as shown in the extra table Extension Cytology Summary Stage Table.",
