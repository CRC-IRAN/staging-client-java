You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2 or T3 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 5:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2 or T3) based on the tumor size.\n\n    Lesion(s) confirmed to dermis\n    Localized, NOS\n    Subcutaneous tissue (through entire dermis)",
