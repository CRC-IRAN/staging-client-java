Tumors of the tail of the pancreas arise to the left of the left edge of the aorta.\n\n**Note 2:**  Islets of Langerhans are distributed throughout the pancreas; an islet tumor is coded according to the subsite of the pancreas in which the tumor arises if the information is available.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1 or T2. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 4:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size.\n\n    Confined to pancreas\n    Localized, NOS",
