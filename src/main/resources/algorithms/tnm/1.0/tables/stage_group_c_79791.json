If your registry submits the directly assigned Stage Groups to agencies other than SEER, please check the AJCC manual to ensure you are using the appropriate logic.\n\n**Note 2 :** Serum Tumor Markers are used to calculate S Stage.  They can be found in the following site-specific factors:  \n  \n     SSF 13: Post-Orchiectomy Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) Range  \n     SSF 15: Post-Orchiectomy Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) Range  \n     SSF 16: Post-Orchiectomy Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Range  \n  \nThe S Stage is set using the following logic:  \n\n     SX - Serum marker studies not available  \n     S0 - Serum marker study levels within normal limits  \n     S1 - LDH: < 1.5 x N **and** hCG: < 5000 **and** AFP < 1000  \n     S2 - LDH: 1.5 to 10 x N **or** hCG: 5000 to 50,000  **or**  AFP: 1000 to 10,000  \n     S3 - LDH: >10 x N **or** hCG: > 50,000  **or**  AFP: > 10,000",
