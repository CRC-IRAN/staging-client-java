  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  True invasion of the choroid is defined as one or more solid nests of tumor cells that fills or replaces the choroid and has pushing borders.  This is distinguished from artifactual invasion, or groups of tumor cells in the open spaces beween intraocular structures, extraocular tissues, and/or subarachnoid space.  Focal choroidal invasion is a solid nest of tumor measuring less than 3 millimeter (mm) in maximum diameter.  Massive choroidal invasion is a solid tumor nest 3 mm or more in maximum diameter.\n\n**Note 2**:  For correct calculation of derived staging fields for this schema, Clinical T, Path T, and Site-Specific Factor 1, Extension Evaluated at Enucleation, must both be coded, whether or not an enucleation was performed. Information from enucleation is excluded from Clinical T and coded in Site-Specific Factor 1 and Path T.\n\n**Note 3**: For information regarding stage calculations, refer to Clinical T Note 3 and the special calculation extra tables.",
