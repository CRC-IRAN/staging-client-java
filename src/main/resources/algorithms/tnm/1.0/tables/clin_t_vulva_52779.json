Code primary tumor extension based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IVA if it is based on primary tumor extension or the basis is unknown.\n\n**Note 3:**  FIGO no longer includes Stage 0 (Tis) for this site.\n\n**Note 4:**  FIGO Stage I, IA and IB are defined by size of tumor, involvement of vulva OR vulva and perineum, and depth of stromal invasion.\n\n**Note 5:**  The depth of invasion is defined as the measurement of the tumor from the epithelial-stromal junction of the adjacent most superficial dermal papilla to the deepest point of invasion.\n\n**Note 6:** T3 is not used by FIGO. They label it T4. If you have a record which states T4, assign T3.",
