  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:**  Inferior mesenteric nodes are coded in distant metastasis for cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, and hepatic flexure.  Superior mesenteric nodes are coded in distant metastasis for all colon sites.  Mesenteric node(s), NOS are coded in regional lymph nodes (N).\n\n**Note 3:**  For rectosigmoid primaries, middle and superior rectal nodes are regional lymph nodes. Inferior rectal nodes are distant metastasis. For rectum primaries, the inferior, middle, and superior rectal nodes are regional lymph nodes. Rectal nodes, NOS are regional lymph nodes for both rectosigmoid and rectum.\n\n**Note 4:**  For rectum primaries, obturator nodes and internal iliac (hypogastric) nodes, NOS are regional lymph nodes; for rectosigmoid primaries, these are distant metastasis. \n\n**Note 5:**  For rectosigmoid primaries, left colic nodes and colic nodes, NOS are regional lymph nodes; for rectum primaries, these are distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 6:**  Regional lymph node involvement is rare for GISTs, so that cases in which the nodal status is not associated clinically or pathologically could be considered N0 instead of cNX or pNX.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes for rectosigmoid junction and rectum**\n    \n**All sites:** \n\n    Hemorrhoidal (middle, superior) \n    Inferior mesenteric \n    Mesenteric [NOS] \n    Perirectal \n    Rectal (middle) \n    Rectal [NOS] \n    Rectal (superior) \n    Rectosigmoid (paracolic/pericolic)\n    Sigmoidal (sigmoid mesenteric)\n\n**Rectosigmoid (C199)** \n\n    Colic, (NOS) \n    Left colic\n  \n**Rectum (C209)** \n\n    Hemorrhoidal (inferior) \n    Internal iliac (hypogastric)  \n    Lateral (laterosacral) \n    Middle (promontorial) (Gerota's node) \n    Obturator\n    Presacral\n    Rectal (inferior) \n    Sacral (NOS)\n    Sacral promontory",
