  "notes" : "**Note 1:** When both FIGO stage and extension detail are available, record the code with extension detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage.\n\n**Note 2:**  FIGO no longer includes Stage 0 (Tis) for this site.\n\n**Note 3:** To assign a T2 category, stromal connective tissue of the cervix must be involved; endocervical glandular involvement only is not considered a T2 tumor in TNM. Use 123, 133, 143, or 145 if endometrial or myometrial involvement is described.\n\n**Note 4:** FIGO IIIA and IIIB are extension, whereas FIGO IIIC is nodal involvement.  FIGO IVA is extension, whereas FIGO IVB is distant metastasis. FIGO Stage III, NOS and FIGO Stage IV, NOS are assigned based on tumor extension and/or metastasis.  Code CS Extension based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage III, NOS or FIGO Stage IV, NOS only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension.\n\n**Note 5:** Positive cytology is reported separately (CS Site Specific Factor 2), and is not included as a staging element for AJCC 7 staging.  It is included as a staging element for AJCC 6 and Summary Stage. Since \"cancer cells in ascites or in peritoneal washings\" was not specifically categorized in the 1977 Summary Staging Guide, it is unclear to which stage previous cases may have been coded in that staging system.\n\n**Note 6:**  According to the AJCC, extension to the bowel or bladder mucosa must be proven by biopsy in order to rule out bullous edema.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 100-145, and 180-525 ONLY. If it is a CS Version 1 case, (CS Version Input Original equals 01XXXX and Year of Diagnosis is before 2010), the T category for AJCC 6 stages is assigned based on the value of CS Extension and peritoneal cytology coded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2 as shown in the Extension Cytology AJCC 6 Table CSv1. If it is a CS Version 2 case (CS Version Input Original equals 02XXXX or Year of Diagnosis is greater than 2009), the T category for AJCC 6 staging is based on the value of CS Extension and peritoneal cytology coded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2 as shown in the Extension Cytology AJCC 6 Table CSv2.\n- For CS Extension codes 100-120, 125-130, 135-140, 160-400, and 540 ONLY. The SS77 and SS2000 stages are assigned based on the value of CS Extension and peritoneal cytology status coded in CS Site-Specific Factor 2 as shown in the Extension Cytology Summary Stage Table.",
