  "notes" : "**Note 1:** For skin, patch indicates any size skin lesion without significant elevation or induration.\n\n**Note 2:** For skin, plaque indicates any size skin lesion that is elevated or indurated.\n\n**Note 3:** For skin, tumor indicates at least one 1 centimeter (cm) diameter solid or nodular lesion with evidence of depth and/or vertical growth. If a physician describes a skin lesion of less than 1 cm as a tumor, code T2.\n\n**Note 4:** Use code T1 when skin involvement is present but only a general location/site is mentioned (i.e., face, torso, arms, legs). \n\n**Note 5:** Ignore erythroderma if stated to involve less than 50% of the skin. Erythrodema greater than 50% is coded as a T3.\n\n**Note 6:** Physicians use more than one method to estimate percentage of skin involvement by mycosis fungoides (MF).  Code percent of skin involvement as stated by the physician.  If no percentage is stated and no word such as localized or generalized is used and no stage is given, code as percent not stated.\n\n**Note 7:**  Assign T0 ONLY when there is no evidence of any type of skin involvement, including plaques, papules, patches, or tumors.  Note, tumor size is coded as 000 in Tumor Size only if there is no evidence of any tumor(s).",
