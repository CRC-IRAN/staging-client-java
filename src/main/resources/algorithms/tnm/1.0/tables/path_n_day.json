  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Histological examination of a pelvic lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (FIGO considers such cases as pNX). \n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in the field distant metastasis. \n\n**Note 3:** Regional nodes include bilateral and contralateral named nodes. \n\n**Note 4:**  Federation Internationale de Gynecologie at d-Obstetrique (FIGO) Stage IIIC is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  Code regional lymph nodes based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIC only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of lymph node involvement. \n\n**Note 5:**  If the clinician says \"adnexa palpated\" but doesn't mention lymph nodes, assume lymph nodes are not involved, assign N0.\n\n**Note 5:**  If either exploratory or definitive surgery is done with no mention of lymph nodes, assume regional nodes are not involved.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes:**\n\n  **Regional lymph nodes:**\n\n    Aortic:\n        Lateral (lumbar)\n        Para-aortic\n        Periaortic\n    Iliac:\n       Common iliac\n       External iliac\n       Internal iliac (hypogastric):\n           Obturator     \n                Inguinal\n    Intra-abdominal\n    Pelvic\n    Subdiaphragmatic\n  \n    Retroperitoneal, NOS",
