If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (FIGO considers such cases as pNX).

Distant nodes are coded in the field distant metastasis. \n\n**Note 3:** Regional nodes include bilateral and contralateral named nodes. \n\n**Note 4:**  Federation Internationale de Gynecologie at d-Obstetrique (FIGO) Stage IIIC is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  Code regional lymph nodes based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIC only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of lymph node involvement. \n\n**Note 5:**  If the clinician says \"adnexa palpated\" but doesn't mention lymph nodes, assume lymph nodes are not involved, assign N0.\n\n**Note 5:**  If either exploratory or definitive surgery is done with no mention of lymph nodes, assume regional nodes are not involved.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes:**\n\n  **Regional lymph nodes:**\n\n    Aortic:\n        Lateral (lumbar)\n        Para-aortic\n        Periaortic\n    Iliac:\n       Common iliac\n       External iliac\n       Internal iliac (hypogastric):\n           Obturator     \n                Inguinal\n    Intra-abdominal\n    Pelvic\n    Subdiaphragmatic\n  \n    Retroperitoneal, NOS",
