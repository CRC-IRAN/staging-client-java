Tis is mapped to NA and TNM stage group is derived as NA.\n\n**Note 2:**  Mucosal melanomas are aggressive tumors, therefore T1 and T2 are omitted as are Stages I and II.\n\n**Note 3:**  Assign T3 for localized tumor when no other information is available or for extension involving the mucosa only of adjacent sites.\n\n**Note 4:**  Assign T4a or T4b for extension involving the deeper tissues of the primary or adjacent sites.",
