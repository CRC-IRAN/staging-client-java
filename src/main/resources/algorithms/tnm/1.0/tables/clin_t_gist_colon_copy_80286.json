  "notes" : "**Note 1:** TNM does not include an in situ category for GIST tumors. Assign 88 and behavior code /2 for in situ tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon; code depth of invasion or extra-appendiceal spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a T value. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If no tumor size is available, assign TX.\n\n**Note 4:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size.\n\n**All colon subsites**\n\n    Confined to colon\n    Localized, NOS\n\n    Adherent to liver capsule\n    Extension through wall, NOS\n    Invasive tumor in polyp, NOS\n    Invasion of/through serosa (mesothelium) (visceral peritoneum)\n    Invasion of/through serosa with invasion of/through mucosa\n    Invasion through muscularis propria or muscularis, NOS\n    Non-peritonealized pericolic tissues invaded\n    Perimuscular tissue invaded\n    Subserosal tissue/(sub)serosal fat invaded\n    Transmural, NOS\n    Tumor confined to muscular wall\n    Tumor invades through submucosa and muscularis mucosae to involve mucosa    \n     Wall, NOS   \n\n**All colon subsites** \n \n    Abdominal wall\n    Adjacent tissue(s), NOS    \n    Adrenal (suprarenal) gland\n    Bladder\n    Connective tissue\n    Diaphragm\n    Fat, NOS\n    Fistula to skin\n    Gallbladder\n    Mesenteric fat\n    Mesentery \n    Mesocolon\n    Other segment(s) of colon via serosa\n    Pericolic fat\n    Retroperitoneum (excluding fat)\n    Small intestine\n\n**Cecum (C180)**\n\n    Fallopian tube\n    Greater omentum\n    Kidney, right\n    Liver\n    Ovary\n    Ureter, right\n    Uterus\n\n**Ascending colon (C182)**\n\n    Fallopian tube\n    Greater omentum\n    Liver, right lobe\n    Kidney, right\n    Ovary\n    Retroperitoneal fat\n    Ureter, right\n    Uterus\n\n**Transverse colon (C183) and flexures (C184, C185)**\n\n    Bile ducts\n    Gallbladder\n    Gastrocolic ligament\n    Greater omentum\n    Kidney\n    Liver\n    Pancreas\n    Spleen\n    Stomach\n    Ureter\n\n**Descending colon (C186)**\n\n    Fallopian tube\n    Greater omentum\n    Kidney, left\n    Ovary\n    Pelvic wall\n    Retroperitoneal fat\n    Spleen\n    Ureter, left\n    Uterus\n\n**Sigmoid colon (C187)**\n\n    Cul de sac (rectouterine pouch)\n    Greater omentum \n    Fallopian tube\n    Ovary\n    Pelvic wall\n    Ureter\n    Uterus",
