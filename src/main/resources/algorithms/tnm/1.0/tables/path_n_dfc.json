If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0.\n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional nodes, and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis .\n\n**Note 3:**  One or more malignant satellite peritumoral nodules or tumor deposits (TD) in the periappendiceal adipose tissue of a primary carcinoma without histologic evidence of residual lymph node in the nodule may represent discontinuous spread, venous invasion with extravascular spread, or a totally replaced lymph node.    Replaced nodes are counted as positive nodes and coded in CS Lymph Nodes.  TD representing discontinuous spread or venous invasion are coded in CS Extension, and the number of TD representing discontinuous spread or venous invasion is coded in CS Site-Specific Factor 4.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes for appendix:**\n\n    Celiac\n        Anterior (prececal)\n        Ileocolic\n        Posterior (retrocecal)\n        Right colic\n    Colic, NOS\n    Epicolic (adjacent to bowel wall)\n    Mesenteric, NOS\n    Mesocolic, NOS\n    Paracolic/pericolic\n\n    Regional lymph nodes, NOS\n    Lymph nodes, NOS",
