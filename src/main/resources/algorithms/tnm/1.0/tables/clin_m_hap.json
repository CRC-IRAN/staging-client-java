These nodes are now coded in distant metastasis. \n\n**Note 3:** The specific location of the mesenteric nodes determines whether they are regional or distant.  If the specific location is not described, assign N1.\n\n**Note 4:** Porta hepatic nodes are considered distant for Body and Tail and should be coded in distant metastasis.  If the specific location for hepatic nodes is not described, code in regional lymph nodes (N1).",
