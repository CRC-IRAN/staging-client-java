  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  High-grade dysplasia is not always collected by cancer registries but, if collected, it should be assigned Tis.\n\n**Note 2:** Tis includes cancer cells confined within the glandular basement membrane (intraepithelial) or lamina propria (intramucosal) with no extension through muscularis mucosa into submucosa. \n\n**Note 3:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 4:**  Mucinous tumors are identified by morphology codes 8480, 8481, and 8490.\n\n**Note 5:** One or more malignant satellite peritumoral nodules or tumor deposits (TD) in the periappendiceal adipose tissue of a primary carcinoma without histologic evidence of residual lymph node in the nodule may represent discontinuous spread, venous invasion with extravascular spread, or a totally replaced lymph node.  Replaced nodes are counted as positive nodes and coded in Regional lymph nodes.  TD representing discontinuous spread or venous invasion are are assigned T3, and the number of TD representing discontinuous spread or venous invasion is coded in Site-Specific Factor 4.\n\n**Note 6:** Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, macroscopically, is classified T4b. However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion, microscopically, the classification should be pT1, pT2 or pT3. \n\n**Note 7:**  Assign T4b for contiguous extension from the site of origin. Except for intraperitoneal metastases limited to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) of the abdomen for mucinous tumors, discontinuous involvement is coded in distant metastasis.",
