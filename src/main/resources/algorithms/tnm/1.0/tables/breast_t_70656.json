  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Microinvasion: UICC includes the following definition: \"Microinvasion is the extension of cancer cells beyond the basement membrane into the adjacent tissues with no focus more than 0.1 cm in greatest dimension. When there are multiple foci of microinvasion, the size of only the largest focus is used to classify the microinvasion. (Do not use the sum of all individual foci). The presence of multiple foci of microinvasion should be noted, as it is with multiple larger invasive carcinomas.\" \n\n**Note 2:**  Dimpling of the skin, nipple retraction, or other skin changes, except those in T4b and T4d, may occur in T1, T2, or T3 (sub)categories without affecting the classification. Assign the appropriate T1-T3 (sub)category based on the tumor size.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1, T2 or T3 or their subcategories. You may use a physician's statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2, or T3 (sub)categories, but no size or physician's statement of the T1-T3 (sub)category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 4:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T1-T3 (sub)category based on the tumor size.\n\n    Confined to breast tissue and fat including nipple and/or areola\n    Local infiltration of dermal lymphatics adjacent to primary tumor involving skin by direct extension\n    Invasion of subcutaneous tissue\n    Skin infiltration of primary breast including skin of nipple and/or areola\n    Attachment or fixation to pectoral muscle(s) or underlying tissue\n    Deep fixation\n    Invasion of (or fixation to) pectoral fascia or muscle\n    Paget disease of nipple with underlying tumor \n\n    Confined to breast, NOS\n    Localized, NOS\n  \n**Note 5:**  Consider adherence, attachment, fixation, induration, and thickening as clinical evidence of extension to skin or subcutaneous tissue and assign T based on the tumor size (T1-T3 (sub)category).\n\n**Note 6:**  Consider fixation, NOS as involvement of pectoralis muscle and assign T based on the tumor size (T1-T3 (sub)category)).\n\n**Note 7:** Paget disease with no underlying tumor is assigned to Tis but may be described as Paget disease, NOS (/3), invasive Paget disease (/3) or in situ Paget disease (/2) with no underlying tumor. \n\n*Note 8:** In assigning the T category, Paget disease associated with an underlying tumor is classified by the underlying tumor characteristics and size:\n\n     If Paget disease is associated with a DCIS or LCIS tumor, it is classified as Tis (DCIS) or Tis (LCIS), respectively and the behavior code is /3 (if Paget disease, NOS or invasive Paget disease) or /2 (if in situ Paget disease).\n\n    If Paget disease is associated with an underlying invasive tumor confined to the breast, it is classified based on the size of the tumor as T1-T3 (sub)categories and the behavior code is /3 (refer to SEER multiple primary rules for coding the histology code). \n\n**Note 9:**  Inflammatory Carcinoma: UICC includes the following definition: \"Inflammatory carcinoma of the breast is characterized by diffuse, brawny induration of the skin with an erysipeloid edge, usually with no underlying mass. If the skin biopsy is negative and there is no localized measurable primary cancer, the T category is pTX when pathologically staging a clinical inflammatory carcinoma (T4d). \n\n**Note 10:**  A clinical description of inflammation, erythema, edema, peau d'orange, or other terms describing skin changes without a stated diagnosis of inflammatory carcinoma should be assigned to T4b.",
