  "notes" : "**Note 1**: Histological examination of a regional lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 16 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0.\n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 3:**  Hepatoduodenal nodes are regional for primaries of the lesser curvature of the stomach.  They are coded in distant metastasis for all other subsites in this schema.\n\n**Note 4:**  Regional lymph node involvement is rare for GISTs, so that cases in which the nodal status is not associated clinically or pathologically could be considered N0 instead of cNX or pNX.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes for Stomach are:**\n\n    Left gastric (superior gastric), NOS:\n      Cardial\n      Cardioesophageal\n      Gastric, left\n      Gastropancreatic, left\n      Lesser curvature\n      Lesser omental\n      Paracardial\n    Pancreaticosplenic (pancreaticolienal)\n    Pancreaticoduodenal\n    Perigastric, NOS\n    Peripancreatic\n    Right gastric (inferior gastric), NOS:\n      Gastrocolic\n      Gastroduodenal\n      Gastroepiploic (gastro-omental), right or NOS\n      Gastrohepatic\n      Greater curvature\n      Greater omental\n      Pyloric, NOS: infrapyloric, subpyloric, suprapyloric\n    Splenic (lienal), NOS:\n    Gastroepiploic (gastro-omental), left\n    Splenic hilar\n    Nodule(s) in perigastric fat\n    Celiac:\n      Hepatic (excluding gastrohepatic) \n      Hepatoduodenal \n    For lesser curvature: hepatoduodenal",
