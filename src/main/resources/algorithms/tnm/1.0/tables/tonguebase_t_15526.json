  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The intrinsic muscles of tongue are four paired muscles within the tongue which control its shape.  The extrinsic muscles originate from structures outside the tongue and control its positioning.\n\n**Note 2:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1, T2 or T3. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2 or T3 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 3:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2 or T3) based on the tumor size.\n\n    Invasive tumor on one side confined to posterior one-third of tongue:\n       Lamina propria\n       Submucosa\n    Anterior two-thirds of tongue for base of tongue\n    Base of tongue for lingual tonsil\n    Base of tongue tumor crosses midline\n    Floor of mouth\n    Glossoepiglottic fold\n    Glossopharyngeal fold\n    Lateral pharyngeal wall\n    Lingual tonsil for base of tongue\n    Lower gingiva\n    Midline tumor\n    Musculature, intrinsic or NOS \n    Pharyngoepiglottic fold\n    Soft palate, inferior surface or NOS including uvula\n    Sublingual gland\n    Tonsillar pillars and fossae\n    Tumor of lingual tonsil on both sides\n    Tonsils\n    Vallecula\n\n    Confined to base of tongue\n    Localized, NOS",
