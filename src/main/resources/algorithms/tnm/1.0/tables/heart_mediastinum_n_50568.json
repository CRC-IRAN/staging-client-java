Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:**  Regional lymph nodes are defined as those in the vicinity of the primary tumor.\n\n**Note 3:**   Regional lymph node involvement is rare.  For this schema, if there is no mention of lymph node involvement clinically, assume that lymph nodes are negative.
