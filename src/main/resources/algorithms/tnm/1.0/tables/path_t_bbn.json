Use codes 120 and 220 for extension of tumor involving the wall of both renal pelvis and ureter.\n\n**Note 3:**  Direct invasion of the bladder by a ureteral tumor is classified by the depth of greatest invasion of the bladder or ureter for AJCC staging.  \n\n**Note 4:** If CS Extension code is 050 or 060, Behavior ICD-O-3 must be coded as 2.  If CS Extension code is 105 or greater, Behavior ICD-O-3 must be coded as 3.",
