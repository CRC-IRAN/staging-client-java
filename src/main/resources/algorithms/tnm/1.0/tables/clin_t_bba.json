  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  AJCC considers \"in situ carcinoma of salivary gland\" an impossible diagnosis.  Any case so coded will be mapped to an unknown AJCC stage, in situ Summary Stage.\n\n**Note 2:**  Periosteum is a fibrous membrane that wraps the outer surface of bones.  Mucoperiosteum is a compound structure of mucous membrane and periosteum.  Cortical bone is the dense compact outer layer of bone.\n\n**Note 3:**  The assignment of T1 and T2 categories for tumors of major salivary glands without exparenchymal extension is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields.  However the two fields are coded independently: for example the record may document size but not extension, other than the physician's statement of the T category. Use codes 305, 310, 408, 625, 810, or 815 as appropriate to code CS Extension based on a statement of T when no other extension information is available.\n\n**Note 4:**  Use code 300 for localized tumor only if no information is available to assign codes 100 or 305.",
  "footnotes" : "-For CS Extension codes 100-350 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 7 staging is assigned based on value of CS Tumor Size as shown in the Extension Size Table for this schema.\n-For CS Extension codes 100-350 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 6 staging is assigned based on value of CS Tumor Size as shown in the Extension Size Table for this schema.",
