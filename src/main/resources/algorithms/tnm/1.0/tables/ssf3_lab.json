  "notes" : "**Note 1**:  Include information from prostatectomy and autopsy in this field and not in Clinical T.  Only use histologic information from prostatectomy, including simple prostatectomy with negative margins, and autopsy in this field.  Information from biopsy of extraprostatic sites is coded in Clinical T; information from needle core biopsy of prostate is coded in Site-Specific Factor 14.\n\n**Note 2**:  Code 970 if there is no prostatectomy performed within the first course of treatment.\n\n**Note 3**:  Limit information in this field to first course of treatment in the absence of disease progression.\n\n**Note 4**:  AJCC considers \"in situ carcinoma of prostate gland\" an impossible diagnosis.  Any case so coded is mapped to TX for AJCC stage and in situ Summary Stage.\n\n**Note 5**:  When prostate cancer is an incidental finding during a prostatectomy for other reasons (for example, a cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer), use the appropriate code for the extent of disease found (for example, involvement in one lobe, both lobes, or more).\n\n**Note 6**:  When the apical margin, distal urethral margin, bladder base margin, or bladder neck margin is involved and there is no extracapsular extension, use code 400.\n\n**Note 7**:  Involvement of the prostatic urethra does not alter the extension code.\n\n**Note 8**:  \"Frozen pelvis\" is a clinical term which means tumor extends to pelvic sidewall(s).  In the absence of a more detailed statement of involvement, assign this to code 600.\n\n**Note 9**:  For information regarding stage calculations, refer to Clinical T Note 8 and the Special Calculation extra tables.",
