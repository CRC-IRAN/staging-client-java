Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:**  Regional nodes include bilateral and contralateral involvement of named nodes.\n\n**Note 3:**  The Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO), stages are included for coding where no more specific information is available in the record.  When both FIGO stage and regional lymph node detail are available, record the code with regional lymph node detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage.\n\n**Note 4:** Assign lymph nodes based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIB if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of lymph node involvement, or if there is no statement that FIGO Stage IIIB is assigned based on extension or lymph node involvement.\n\n**Note 5:**  If the clinician says \"adnexa palpated\" but does not mention lymph nodes, assume lymph nodes are not involved.\n\nRegional lymph node(s) for Corpus:\n\n    Aortic, NOS:\n        Lateral (lumbar)\n        Para-aortic\n        Periaortic\n    Iliac, NOS:\n        Common\n        External\n        Internal (hypogastric)\n            Obturator\n    Paracervical\n    Parametrial\n    Pelvic, NOS\n    Sacral, NOS:\n        Lateral (laterosacral)\n        Middle (promontorial) (Gerota's node)\n        Presacral\n        Uterosacral\n\n    Pelvic lymph nodes, NOS\n\n    FIGO Stage IIIC (pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes)\n    FIGO Stage IIIC1 (pelvic lymph nodes)\n    FIGO Stage IIIC2 (para-aortic lymph nodes WITH or WITHOUT pelvic lymph nodes)",
