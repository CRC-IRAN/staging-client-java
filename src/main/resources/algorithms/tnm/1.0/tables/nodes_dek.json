If the specific level cannot be determined, consider them as Level V nodes. \n\n**Note 3:**  The description of lymph nodes has been standardized across the head and neck schemas.  All lymph node levels and groups listed here are considered regional nodes (delete -  for AJCC staging).  Summary Stage 1977 and Summary Stage 2000 divide these nodes into regional and distant groups. (or maybe deletel whole note 3?)",
