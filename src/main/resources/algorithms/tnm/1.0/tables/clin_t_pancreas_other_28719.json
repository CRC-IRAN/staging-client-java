You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 4:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size.\n\n    Confined to pancreas\n    Localized, NOS",
