  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The assignment of the T1 category for cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas with one or no high-risk features is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T1 category may be used to code both tumor size and/or primary tumor if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields. The two fields are coded separately though.\n\n**Note 2:**  TNM 7th Edition T1 and T2 categories are based on size and high risk features and not depth of invasion or extension. AJCC 7th Edition includes a T3 category for head and neck skin primaries only.\n\n*Note 3:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category (T1 or T2) based on the tumor size.\n\n    Adjacent connective tissue excluding skeletal muscle\n    Confined to scrotum\n    Skeletal muscle\n    Subcutaneous tissue\n    Underlying cartilage\n\n    Adjacent organs/structures:\n        Male genital organs:\n            Epididymis\n            Penis\n            Prostate\n            Spermatic cord\n            Testis\n    Further contiguous extension:\n    Other organs and structures in male pelvis:\n        Bladder\n        Rectum\n        Urethra\n\n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 3:**  In the case of multiple simultaneous tumors, code the tumor with the greatest extension.\n\n**Note 4:**  Skin ulceration does not alter the T category.",
