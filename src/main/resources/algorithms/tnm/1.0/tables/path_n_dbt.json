  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Histological examination of a regional lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (1)\n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 3:**  Bilateral or contralateral nodes are regional nodes for head, neck, and truncal tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Truncal tumors may also drain to both cephalad and caudal primary nodal basins as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  \n* Clinical assessment of bilateral/contralateral or cephalad/caudal regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed.\n\n**Note 4:**  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins.  Secondary basins are regional for TNM.\n\n**Note 5:** UICC only defines N2, while AJCC defines N2a, N2b, and N2c. If a record comes in with N2a, N2b, or N2c, reassign it to N2. N2 and the subcategories of N2 all stage the same way.\n\n**Note 6:** Size of lymph nodes must be known to assign N. You may use a physicianâs statement of the N category if this is the only information in the medical record. \n* If the size of the lymph node(s) is not known, assign N1. \n\n**Note 7:** Assign the appropriate N category (N1, N2 or N3) based on the size of the lymph node metastasis for the following descriptions: \n\n**Regional lymph nodes by skin primary site**\n* Head and Neck sites include bilateral or contralateral nodes\n\n**Lip (C440):**\n                                                        \n    Cervical\n    Facial, NOS:                                             \n       Buccinator (buccal)                                  \n       Nasolabial \n    Mandibular, NOS                             \n    Parotid, NOS:                                            \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular                                         \n    Submental                                         \n    Submandibular (submaxillary)             \n                \n**External ear/auditory canal (C442):**\n                                 \n    Cervical\n    Mastoid (post-/retro-auricular) (occipital)             \n    Preauricular                                             \n       \n**Face, Other (cheek, chin, forehead, jaw, nose and temple) (C443):**   \n        \n    Cervical\n    Facial, NOS:                                             \n        Buccinator (buccal)                                  \n        Nasolabial                                           \n    Mandibular, NOS                                         \n    Parotid, NOS:                                            \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular     \n    Submental\n    Submandibular (submaxillary)                                    \n        \n**Scalp (C444):** \n                                                       \n    Mastoid (post-/retro-auricular) (occipital)              \n    Parotid, NOS:                                            \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular                                         \n    Spinal accessory (posterior cervical)\n                    \n**Neck (C444):**\n                                                      \n    Axillary                                                 \n    Mandibular, NOS                                          \n    Mastoid (post-/retro-auricular) (occipital)              \n    Parotid, NOS:                                            \n       Infra-auricular                                      \n       Preauricular                                         \n    Spinal accessory (posterior cervical) \n    Submental                   \n    Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)                    \n     \n**Trunk (C445):** \n                                                     \n    Axillary                                                     \n    Cervical                                                     \n    Internal mammary (parasternal)\n    Femoral (superficial inguinal)                               \n    Supraclavicular (transverse cervical)                        \n    \n**Arm/Shoulder (C446):**\n                                                    \n    Axillary                                                     \n    Epitrochlear for hand/forearm                                \n    Spinal accessory for shoulder                                \n     \n**Leg/Hip (C447):**\n                                                         \n    Femoral (superficial inguinal)                               \n    Popliteal for heel and calf                                  \n     \n   **Bidirectional nodal involvement (includes bilateral or contralateral nodes)**\n\n    Upper Trunk: Femoral (or cephalad/caudal drainage from primary tumor)       \n    Lower Trunk: Axillary (or cephalad/caudal drainage from primary tumor)\n                                                                      \n**Secondary nodal basin involvement (includes bilateral or contralateral nodes)**\n         \n    Head and Neck: Supraclavicular                               \n    Arm/Shoulder: Supraclavicular               \n    Leg/Hip: Iliac                                                    \n    All sites: Regional lymph node(s) in secondary nodal basins, NOS",
