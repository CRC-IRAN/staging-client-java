  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) allows patients to be classified according to their functional impairment.  This classification can be used to compare effectiveness of different therapies and to assess prognosis for individual patients.  The lower the Karnofsky scale value, the worse the predicted survival for most serious illnesses.\n\n**Note 2:**  Record the KPS only as specifically documented in the patient's record by the physician.  Do not attempt to determine the KPS from other information in the record.  If the KPS value is expressed in terms of a range, use the higher value.  For example, use code 080 if the physician states \"The patient's Karnofsky score is between 70 and 80.\n\n**Note 3:**  For reference only, the classification scale is listed here:\n\n0    Dead\n10    Moribund, fatal processes progressing rapidly\n20    Very sick, hospitalization necessary; active supportive treatment necessary\n30    Severely disabled; hospitalization is indicated although death not imminent\n40    Disabled; requires special care and assistance\n50    Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care\n60    Requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most personal needs\n70    Cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or do active work\n80    Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease\n90    Able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease.\n100    Normal;no complaints; no evidence of disease",
