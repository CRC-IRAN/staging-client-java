FIGO Stage III is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  Code CS Extension based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage III only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension.\n\n**Note 2:**  FIGO no longer includes Stage 0 (Tis) for this site.\n\n**Note 3:** The presence of bullous edema is not sufficient evidence to classify a tumor as T4.\n\n**Note 3:**  The pelvic wall is defined as muscle, fascia, neurovascular structures, or skeletal portions of the bony pelvis.",
