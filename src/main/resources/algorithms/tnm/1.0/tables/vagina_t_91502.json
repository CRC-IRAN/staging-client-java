FIGO Stage III is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  \n\n**Note 2:**    FIGO does not include an in situ category for tumors of the vagina, but TNM does. Assign pTis (behavior code /2) for in situ cases. \n\n**Note 3:** The presence of bullous edema is not sufficient evidence to classify a tumor as T4.\n\n**Note 3:**  The pelvic wall is defined as muscle, fascia, neurovascular structures, or skeletal portions of the bony pelvis.",
