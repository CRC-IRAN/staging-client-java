  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  AJCC considers \"in situ carcinoma of ovary\" an impossible diagnosis.  Any case so coded will be mapped to an unknown AJCC stage and an in situ Summary Stage.\n\n**Note 2:**  AJCC TNM values correspond to the stages accepted by the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO), and FIGO stages are included for coding where no more specific information is available in the record.  When both FIGO stage and extension detail are available, record the code with extension detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage. Note that FIGO uses a single stage value which corresponds to different groupings of T, N, and M values.  FIGO Stage IIIC is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  Code CS Extension based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIC only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension. If FIGO Stage IIIC is specified but it is unknown whether it is based on extension or lymph nodes, code to CS Lymoh Nodes\n\n**Note 3:**  T1 and T2 tumors with malignant ascites are categorized as T1c and T2c (FIGO Stages IC and IIC), respectively.  Ascites, NOS is considered negative. \n\n**Note 4:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following pelvic organs are included in the T2 category (FIGO Stage II) and coded in the range 500-650: adnexa, NOS; bladder and bladder serosa; broad ligament (mesovarium); cul de sac; fallopian tubes; parametrium; pelvic peritoneum; pelvic wall; rectosigmoid; rectum; sigmoid colon; sigmoid mesentery; pelvic ureter; uterus and uterine serosa. \n\n**Note 5:**  Peritoneal implants outside the pelvis (codes 700-730) must be microscopically confirmed.  Peritoneal implants may also be called seeding, salting, talcum powder appearance, or studding. \n\n**Note 6:**  If implants are mentioned, determine whether they are in the pelvis or in the abdomen and code appropriately (600-650) or (700-730).  If the location is not specified, use code 750. \n\n**Note 7:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following abdominal organs by way of peritoneal seeding or implants are included in the T3 category (FIGO Stage III) and coded in the range 700-750: abdominal mesentery; diaphragm; gallbladder; infracolic omentum; kidneys; large intestine except rectum, rectosigmoid, and sigmoid colon; liver (peritoneal surface); omentum; pancreas; pericolic gutter; peritoneum, NOS; small intestine; spleen; stomach; and ureters outside pelvis.  Residual tumor in any of these organs would be considered FIGO III and coded in the 700-750 range below and in CS Site-Specific Factors 3 and 4.  (Hematogenous metastases are included in M1 (FIGO Stage IV) disease.)\n\n**Note 8:**  Parenchymal liver nodules are coded in CS Mets at DX. \n\n**Note 9:**  Since \"cancer cells in ascites or in peritoneal washings\" was not specifically categorized in the 1977 Summary Staging Guide, it is unclear to which stage previous cases may have been coded. \n\n**Note 10:**  In some registries benign/borderline ovarian tumors are reportable by agreement.  If the tumor being reported is benign or borderline, code CS Extension to 999.",
