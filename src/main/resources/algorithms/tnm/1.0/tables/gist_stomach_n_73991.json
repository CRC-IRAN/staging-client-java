Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 2:**  Hepatoduodenal nodes are regional for primaries of the lesser curvature of the stomach.  They are coded in distant metastasis for all other subsites in this schema.\n\n**Note 3:**  Regional lymph node involvement is rare for GISTs, so that cases in which the nodal status is not associated clinically or pathologically could be considered N0 instead of cNX or pNX.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes for Stomach are:**\n\n    Celiac:\n       Hepatic (excluding gastrohepatic) \n       Hepatoduodenal     \n    Left gastric (superior gastric), NOS:\n       Cardial\n       Cardioesophageal\n       Gastric, left\n       Gastropancreatic, left\n       Lesser curvature\n       Lesser omental\n       Paracardial\n    Hepatoduodenal (for lesser curvature)  \n    Nodule(s) in perigastric fat    \n    Pancreaticosplenic (pancreaticolienal)\n    Pancreaticoduodenal\n    Perigastric, NOS\n    Peripancreatic\n    Right gastric (inferior gastric), NOS:\n       Gastrocolic\n       Gastroduodenal\n       Gastroepiploic (gastro-omental), right or NOS\n       Gastrohepatic\n       Greater curvature\n       Greater omental\n       Pyloric, NOS: infrapyloric, subpyloric, suprapyloric\n    Splenic (lienal), NOS:\n        Gastroepiploic (gastro-omental), left\n        Splenic hilar",
