Assign primary tumor extension based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIB or FIGO Stage IV [NOS] only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of primary tumor extension.  Code a statement of FIGO Stage IIIB in regional lymph nodes  if unknown if based on primary tumor extension.  Code a stage of FIGO Stage IV [NOS] in distant metastasis if unknown if based on primary tumor extension.\n\n**Note 3:**  FIGO no longer includes Stage 0 (Tis) for this site.\n\n**Note 4:**  All macroscopically visible lesions, even with superficial invasion, are assigned toT1b/FIGO Stage IB.\n\n**Note 5:**  Involvement of the anterior and/or posterior septum, the tissue between the vagina and bladder and between the vagina and rectum, is coded as involvement of the vaginal wall.",
