  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Non-invasive carcinomas in the esophagus formerly called in situ are now called high grade dysplasia. High grade dysplasia and severe dysplasia are generally not reportable in cancer registries, but if a registry does collect these, assign Tis.\n\n**Note 2:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of esophagus or to cardia of stomach and code depth of invasion or extra-esophageal spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 3:**  The three layers of the mucosa (epithelium, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosae) may be called the m1, m2, and m3 layers.  The submucosa may be described as having inner, middle, and outer thirds called sm1, sm2, and sm3.\n\n**Note 4:**  If the diagnosis states linitis plastica and no other information regarding primary tumor is available, assign T1.  Linitis plastica is defined as diffuse involvement of the entire stomach wall.\n\n**Note 5:**  Assign T4a for contiguous extension from the site of origin. Discontinuous involvement is coded in distant metastasis.except for implants within the stomach (T1).",
