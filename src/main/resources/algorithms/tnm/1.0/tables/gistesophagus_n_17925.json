  "notes" : "**Note 1:**   Regional lymph node involvement is rare for GISTs, so that cases in which the nodal status is not associated clinically or pathologically could be considered N0 instead of cNX or pNX.\n\n**Note 2:** Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 3:**  Regional lymph nodes for any part of the esophagus fall in the range from periesophageal/cervical to the celiac region.  Contralateral and bilateral cervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal lymph nodes are included.\n\n**Note 4:**  Celiac nodes are coded in regional lymph nodes for lower thoracic (abdominal) esophagus; they are coded in distant metastasis for cervical and intrathoracic (upper and middle) esophagus.  Cervical nodes, NOS are coded in regional lymph nodes for cervical esophagus; they are coded in distant metastasis for upper and lower thoracic (abdominal) esophagus.\n\n**Note 5:**  Lymph node stations/groups are listed in parentheses when applicable.  \n\n**Regional Lymph Nodes for Esophagus (including contralateral or bilateral):** \n\n**All esophagus subsites:**\n\n    Anterior mediastinal (6)\n    Mediastinal, NOS\n    Peri-/paraesophageal (8L, 8M)\n\n**Cervical esophagus only (C150):**\n\n    Anterior deep cervical (laterotracheal) (recurrent laryngeal)\n    Anterior mediastinal (6)\n    Aortopulmonary (5)\n    Cervical, NOS                    \n    Cervical (deep), NOS\n    Diaphragmatic (15)\n    Internal jugular, NOS\n    Jugulodigastric (subdigastric)\n    Mediastinal, NOS\n    Para-aortic (ascending aorta or phrenic)\n    Paratracheal (2R, 2L, 4R, 4L)\n    Posterior mediastinal  (3P)\n    Pulmonary ligament (9)\n    Scalene (inferior deep cervical) (1)\n    Subaortic\n    Supraclavicular (transverse cervical) (1)  \n    Superior mediastinal\n \n**Upper thoracic esophagus only (C151, C153):**\n\n    Cervical lymph nodes\n\n**Lower thoracic (abdominal) esophagus only (C152, C155):**\n\n    Aortopulmonary (5)\n    Diaphragmatic (15)\n    Celiac lymph nodes (20)\n    Left gastric (superior gastric) (17): cardiac (cardial), lesser curvature, perigastric, NOS\n    Para-aortic (ascending aorta or phrenic)\n    Paratracheal (2R, 2L, 4R, 4L)\n    Posterior mediastinal (3P) (tracheoesophageal)\n    Pulmonary ligament (9)\n    Subaortic \n    Superior mediastinal\n   \n**Intrathoracic esophagus, upper (C153) or middle (C154), only:**\n\n    Aortopulmonary (5)\n    Carinal (tracheobronchial) (10R,10L) (tracheal bifurcation)\n    Cervical: deep (NOS), lower (NOS), middle (NOS), upper (NOS)\n    Diaphragmatic (15)\n    Hilar (bronchopulmonary) (proximal lobar) (pulmonary root)\n    Internal jugular, NOS\n    Intrabronchial, NOS\n    Jugulo-omohyoid (supraomohyoid)\n    Jugulodigastric (subdigastric)\n    Left gastric (superior gastric) (17): cardiac (cardial), lesser curvature, perigastric (NOS)\n    Para-aortic (ascending aorta or phrenic)\n    Peritracheal\n    Posterior mediastinal (tracheoesophageal)        \n    Pulmonary ligament (9) \n    Superior mediastinal",
