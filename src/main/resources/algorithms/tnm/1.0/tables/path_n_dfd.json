If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0.\n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in metastasis.\n\n**Note 3:**  Superior and inferior mesenteric nodes are coded in distant metastasis.  Mesenteric nodes, NOS are coded in regional lymph nodes. Mesenteric nodes, NOS are coded in regional lymph nodes.\n\n**Note 4:**  Regional lymph node involvement is rare for GISTs, so that cases in which the nodal status is not associated clinically or pathologically could be considered N0 instead of NX or pNX\n\n**Regional lymph nodes for appendix:**\n\n    Celiac\n        Anterior (prececal)\n        Ileocolic\n        Posterior (retrocecal)\n        Right colic\n    Colic, NOS\n    Epicolic (adjacent to bowel wall)\n    Mesenteric, NOS\n    Mesocolic, NOS\n    Paracolic/pericolic",
