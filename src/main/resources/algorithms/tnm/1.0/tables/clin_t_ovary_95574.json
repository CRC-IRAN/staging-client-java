  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Assign 88 for in situ cases (behavior code /2). TNM does not include an in situ category for ovary tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  TNM values correspond to the stages accepted by the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO), and FIGO stages are included for coding where no more specific information is available in the record.  \n* When both FIGO stage and extension detail are available, record the T category with extension detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage. \n* FIGO Stage IIIC is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  \n* Code primary tumor based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIC only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension. \n* If FIGO Stage IIIC is specified but it is unknown whether it is based on extension or lymph nodes, code to regional lymph nodes.\n\n**Note 3:**  T1 and T2 tumors with malignant ascites are classified as T1c and T2c (FIGO Stages IC and IIC), respectively.  \n* Ascites, NOS is negative. \n\n**Note 4:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following pelvic organs are included in the T2 category (FIGO Stage II): \n* Adnexa, NOS; bladder and bladder serosa; broad ligament (mesovarium); cul de sac; fallopian tubes; parametrium; pelvic peritoneum; pelvic wall; rectosigmoid; rectum; sigmoid colon; sigmoid mesentery; pelvic ureter; uterus and uterine serosa. \n\n**Note 5:**  Peritoneal implants outside the pelvis must be microscopically confirmed.  \n* Peritoneal implants may also be called seeding, salting, talcum powder appearance, or studding. \n\n**Note 6:**  If implants are mentioned, determine whether they are in the pelvis or in the abdomen and code appropriately.  \n* If the location of the implants are not specified, assign T3.\n\n**Note 7:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following abdominal organs by way of peritoneal seeding or implants are included in the T3 category (FIGO Stage III): \n* Abdominal mesentery; diaphragm; gallbladder; infracolic omentum; kidneys; large intestine except rectum, rectosigmoid, and sigmoid colon; liver (peritoneal surface); omentum; pancreas; pericolic gutter; peritoneum, NOS; small intestine; spleen; stomach; and ureters outside pelvis.  \n* Residual tumor in any of these organs are classified as FIGO III and coded in T3 and in **Site-Specific Factors 3 and 4**. (Hematogenous metastases are included in M1 (FIGO Stage IV) disease.)\n\n**Note 8:**  Parenchymal liver nodules are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 9:**  In some registries benign/borderline ovarian tumors are reportable by agreement.  \n* If the tumor being reported is benign or borderline, code primary tumor to TX.",
