  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  High grade dysplasia and severe dysplasia are generally not reportable in cancer registries, but if a registry does collect these, assign Tis.\n\n**Note 2:** Tis includes cancer cells confined within the glandular basement membrane (intraepithelial) or mucosal lamina propria (intramucosal) with no extension through the muscular mucosae into the submucosa.\n\n**Note 3:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon/rectum or to the ileum from the cecum; code depth of invasion or extracolonic spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 4:**  Direct invasion into T4b includes invasion of other organs or segments of the colorectum by way of the serosa, as confirmed on microscopic examination, or for tumors in a retroperitoneal or subperitoneal location, direct invasion of other organs or structures by virtue of extension beyond the muscularis propria. \n\n**Note 5:**  Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, macroscopically, is classified T4b. However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion, microscopically, the classification should be pT1, pT2 or pT3.\n\n**Note 6:** Assign T4b for contiguous extension from the site of origin. Discontinuous involvement is coded in distant metastasis.",
