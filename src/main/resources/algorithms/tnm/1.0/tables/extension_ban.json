  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  If there is a discrepancy between the Clark level and the pathologic description of extent (invasion into the layers of the dermis), use the higher (more extensive) code.\n\n**Note 2:**  Code the greatest extent of invasion from any procedure performed on the lesion, whether it is described as a biopsy or an excision.  For example, if a punch biopsy with involvement of Clark level IV is followed by a re-excision with residual tumor involving Clark level II, use Clark level IV. \n\n**Note 3:**  Satellite lesions/nodules or in-transit metastases are coded in SEER Regional Nodes. \n\n (suggest deleting Note 3 - dependent on size of lesions/nodules or in-transit mets, this descriptor would be coded in either, SEER Primary Tumor, SEER Regional Nodes or SEER Mets. - bjmatt - I would leave note but change at how I put it above - code in SEER Regional Nodes, satellite/in-transit are considered regional for Sum stage)\n\n**Note 4:**  Ulceration of the melanoma is coded in Site-Specific Factor 2.",
