The tissues include fat, striated and smooth muscle, and fibroconnective, vascular, lymphoid, peripheral nerve, and optic nerve tissue.\n\n**Note 2:** TNM does not include an in situ category for orbit tumors. Assign 88 and behavior code /2 for in situ tumors.\n\n**Note 3:**  Tis may be used only for non-sarcoma histologies coded to this site. Sarcomas do not present as in situ or noninvasive tumors.",
