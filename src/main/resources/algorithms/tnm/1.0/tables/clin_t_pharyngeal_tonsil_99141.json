  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Carcinoma of the pharyngeal tonsil is staged using the schema for oropharynx.\n\n**Note 2:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1 or T2. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 2:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category (T1 or T2) based on the tumor size.\n\n    Invasive tumor confined to:\n        Adenoid          \n        Pharyngeal tonsil (nasopharyngeal tonsil)      \n        Posterior superior wall (vault)\n    Involvement of inferior wall of nasopharynx (superior surface of soft palate)\n    Nasal cavity\n    Oropharynx\n    Pterygopalatine fossa \n    Soft palate, inferior surface including uvula\n\n    Any of the above WITH parapharyngeal extension\n\n    Confined to pharyngeal tonsil \n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 3:**  Parapharyngeal involvement denotes postero-lateral infiltration of tumor beyond the pharyngobasilar fascia.  The pharyngobasilar fascia is the fibrous layer of the pharyngeal wall between the mucosa and the muscular layer, attached superiorly to the basilar part of the occipital bone and diminishing in thickness as it descends.\n\n**Note 4:**  The masticator space primarily consists of the muscles of mastication, the medial and lateral pterygoid, masseter, and temporalis muscles.  The space also includes the ramus of the mandible and the third division of cranial nerve V as it passes through the foramen ovale into the suprahyoid neck.",
