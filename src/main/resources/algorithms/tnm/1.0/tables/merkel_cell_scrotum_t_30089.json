You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2 or T3 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 5:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size.\n\n    Lesion(s) confined to dermis\n    Confined to scrotum\n\n    Subcutaneous tissue (through entire dermis)\n    Adjacent connective tissue  EXCLUDING deep fascia\n\n    Localized, NOS",
