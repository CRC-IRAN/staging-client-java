AJCC 7th Edition includes a T3 category for head and neck skin primaries only.\n\n**Note 2:**  In the case of multiple simultaneous tumors, code the tumor with the greatest extension.\n\n**Note 3:**  Skin ulceration does not alter the T category. \n\n**Note 4:**  The assignment of the T1 category for cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas with one or no high-risk features is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T1 category may be used to code both tumor size and/or primary tumor if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields. The two fields are coded separately though.",
