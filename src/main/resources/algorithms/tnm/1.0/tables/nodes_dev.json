Central lymph nodes are located in the trunk, including mediastinal, para-aortic, and mesenteric nodes.\n\n**Note 2**:  Involvement of peripheral and central lymph nodes, distant nodes for ocular adnexal lymphomas, is coded in CS Lymph Nodes and not in CS Mets at DX.\n\n**Note 3**: When coding Regional Nodes Positive and Regional Nodes Examined, only include regional nodes. Do not include distant nodes coded in CS Lymph Nodes. If the only information available is for Lymph Nodes, NOS, coded as 800 in CS Lymph Nodes, assume these are regional nodes for coding Regional Nodes Positive and Regional Nodes Examined.",
