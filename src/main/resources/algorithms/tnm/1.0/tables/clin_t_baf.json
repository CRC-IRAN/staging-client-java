Trabecular, cancellous, or spongy bone (spongiosa) is a porous network of tissue filling the interior of bone, decreasing weight and allowing room for blood vessels and marrow.\n\n**Note 2:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size when involvement is limited to the cortical bone. Involvement through cortical bone is required for assignment of T4a. \n\n    Invasive tumor on one side confined to:\n        Lamina propria\n        Submucosa\n    \n    Adjacent oral cavity\n    Bone, NOS\n    Cortical bone of mandible\n    Cortical bone of maxilla\n    Cortical bone, NOS\n    Inferior surface of soft palate\n    Lateral pharyngeal wall\n    Lingual surface of epiglottis\n    Mandible, NOS\n    Maxilla, NOS\n    Musculature invaded\n    Oropharynx\n    Vallecula\n\n    Localized, NOS",
