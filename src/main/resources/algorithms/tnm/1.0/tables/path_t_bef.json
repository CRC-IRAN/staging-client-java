The extrinsic muscles originate from structures outside the tongue and control its positioning.\n\n**Note 2:**  TNM does not include a Tis or TX category for melanoma of mucosa of head and neck sites. Tis and TX are mapped to NA and TNM stage group is derived as NA.\n\n**Note 3:**  TNM does not include a T1 or T2 category for mucosal melanoma of head and neck sites.\n\n**Note 4:**  Assign T3 for extension involving the mucosa only of adjacent sites.  Assign T4a or T4b for extension involving the deeper tissues of the primary or adjacent sites.\n\n**Note 5:**  Assign T3 for localized tumor when no other",
