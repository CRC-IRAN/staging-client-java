Assign TX and behavior code /2 for in situ cases.\n\n**Note 3:** FIGO Stage IV, NOS is assigned based on tumor extension and/or metastasis.  Code primary tumor based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IV, NOS only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension.\n\n**Note 4:** Extension to the bowel or bladder mucosa must be proven by biopsy in order to rule out bullous edema.",
