  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  When both Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and extension detail are available, record the code with extension detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage. FIGO Stage IIIC is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  \n* Code primary tumor based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage IIIC only if it is known that the stage value is assigned because of tumor extension.\n\n**Note 2:** FIGO does not include an in situ category for tumors of the fallopian tube, but TNM does. Assign pTis (behavior code /2) for in situ cases. \n\n**Note 3:**  Liver capsule metastasis is T3/Stage III, liver parenchymal metastasis, M1/Stage IV. \n\n**Note 4:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following pelvic organs are assigned as FIGO Stage II and coded in T2a or T2b:\n * Adnexa, NOS; bladder, bladder serosa; broad ligament (mesovarium); cul de sac; contralateral fallopian tube; parametrium; pelvic peritoneum; pelvic wall; rectum; sigmoid colon; sigmoid mesentery; ureter; uterus; uterine serosa.\n\n**Note 5:**  Both extension to and discontinuous metastasis to any of the following abdominal organs are classified as FIGO Stage III and coded in T3: \n* Abdominal mesentery; diaphragm; gallbladder; infracolic omentum; kidneys; large intestine except rectum and sigmoid colon; liver (peritoneal surface); omentum; pancreas; pericolic gutter; peritoneum, NOS; small intestine; spleen; stomach; ureters.",
