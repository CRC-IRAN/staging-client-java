  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The parenchyma of the kidney includes the following structures: cortex (outer layer of kidney), renal columns; medulla, medullary rays, renal pyramids, and renal papillae; nephrons (renal corpuscle, loops of Henle, proximal and distal tubules, collecting duct); glomerulus and surrounding Bowman's capsule.  The most common site for renal parenchymal cancer to develop is in the proximal convoluted tubule.  Tumor extension from one of these structures into another is coded 100 in the absence of further involvement.\n\n**Note 2:**  Gerota's fascia is a fibrous tissue sheath surrounding the kidney and suprarenal or adrenal gland.  The perirenal fat, renal capsule, and renal parenchyma lie below the fascia.\n\n**Note 3:**  Information about invasion beyond the capsule, venous involvement, and ipsilateral adrenal gland involvement is collected in this field for anatomic staging.  This information is also collected in CS Site-Specific Factor 1, CS Site-Specific Factor 2, and CS Site-Specific Factor 3, as these factors may have an independent effect on prognosis.\n\n**Note 4:**  AJCC considers \"in situ carcinoma of the renal parenchyma\" an impossible diagnosis.    Any case so coded is mapped to TX for AJCC stage and in situ Summary Stage.\n\n**Note 5:**  Use code 300 (Localized, NOS) only when no further information is available to assign code 100, 200, or 310-360.\n\n**Note 6:**  The assignment of T1 and T2 categories for tumors limited to the kidney is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T category may be used to code CS Tumor Size and/or CS Extension if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields.  However the two fields are coded independently: for example the record may document size but not extension, other than the physician's statement of the T category. Use codes 310-360, 605-625 or 810 as appropriate to code CS Extension based on a statement of T when no other extension information is available. \n\n**Note 7:**:  Direct extension to or other involvement of structures considered M1 in AJCC staging is coded in the data item CS Mets at DX. This includes: contralateral kidney; contralateral ureter; liver from left kidney; spleen from right kidney.",
  "footnotes" : "- For CS Extension codes 100-360 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 7 is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size, as shown in the Extension Size AJCC 7 Table for this site. \n- For CS Extension codes 100-360 ONLY, the T category for AJCC 6 is assigned based on the value of CS Tumor Size, as shown in the Extension Size AJCC 6 Table for this site.",
