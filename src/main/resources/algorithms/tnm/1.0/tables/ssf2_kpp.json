This might include:  physical examination, imaging, diagnostic lymph node biopsy and exploratory surgery (without a resection).  \n\n**Note 2:**  In the rare instance that the number of clinically positive nodes is stated but a clinical N category is not stated, use the code that reflects the most specific statement about the number of nodes.\n\n**Note 3:**  If there is no diagnostic work-up to assess regional lymph nodes, use code 999.  Do not apply the inaccessible nodes rule that presumes unmentioned nodes to be negative.",
