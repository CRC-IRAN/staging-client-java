The tissues include fat, striated and smooth muscle, and fibroconnective, vascular, lymphoid, peripheral nerve, and optic nerve tissue.\n\n**Note 2:**  TNM stages only sarcomas of the orbit. TNM values are derived as NA for all non-sarcoma histologies coded to this site.\n\n**Note 3:**  Tis may be used only for non-sarcoma histologies coded to this site. Sarcomas do not present as in situ or noninvasive tumors.\n\n**Note 4:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size.\n\n    Tumor confined to orbit\n    Localized, NOS",
