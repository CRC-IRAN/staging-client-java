  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Histological examination of a selective neck dissection specimen will ordinarily include 6 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (1)\n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 3:** This field includes all lymph nodes defined as Levels I-VI, retropharyngeal or superior mediastinal lymph nodes (Level VII). \n\n**Note 4:**  Assignment of N value for thyroid does not depend on laterality.  All codes for nodal involvement include ipsilateral, bilateral, contralateral, and midline lymph nodes.\n\n**Note 5:**  The description of lymph nodes has been standardized across the head and neck schemas.  All lymph node levels and groups listed here are considered regional nodes for TNM staging.",
