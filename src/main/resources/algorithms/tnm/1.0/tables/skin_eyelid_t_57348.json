  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  In the case of multiple simultaneous tumors, code the tumor with greatest extension.\n\n**Note 2:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1 or T2. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 3:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category (T1 or T2) based on the tumor size.\n\n    Lesion(s) confined to dermis\n    Minimal infiltration of dermis (Not invading tarsal plate, not at eyelid margin)\n    Subcutaneous tissue (Through entire dermis, not invading tarsal plate, not at eyelid margin)\n    Tumor invades tarsal plate, not at eyelid margin\n    Tumor at eyelid margin\n    Tumor involves full eyelid thickness\n\n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 4:**  Skin ulceration does not alter the T category.\n\n**Note 5:**  Presence of tumor at eyelid margin takes priority over depth of invasion in dermis/tarsal plate.\n\n**Note 6:**  Metastatic skin lesions are coded in distant metastasis.",
