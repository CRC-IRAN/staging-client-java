  "notes" : "**Note 1:** TNM does not include an in situ category for Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) of the rectosigmoid/rectum. Assign TX and behavior code /2 for in situ cases.\n\n**Note 2:**  For rectosigmoid, ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon and rectum; code depth of invasion or rectosigmoidal spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1 (T1a or T1b) and T2. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T (sub)category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 categories, but no size or (sub)category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 4:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T (sub)category (T1, T1a, T1b or T2) based on the tumor size.\n\n    Invasive tumor confined to mucosa, NOS (including intramucosal, NOS)\n    Invades lamina propria, including lamina propria in the stalk of a polyp\n    Confined to and not through the muscularis mucosae, including muscularis mucosae in the stalk of a polyp\n    Submucosa (superficial invasion), including submucosa in the stalk of a polyp\n    For rectum:\n        Intraluminal extension to rectosigmoid\n        Intraluminal extension to anal canal/anus\n\n    Confined to rectosigmoid junction, NOS\n    Confined to rectum, NOS\n    Localized, NOS \n\n**Note 5:**  Assign T4 for tumor with macroscopic adhesions to other organs or structures and for pathologically confirmed tumor in adhesions.  However, if no tumor is present in adhesions upon microscopic examination, use lower codes to describe the microscopically confirmed depth of tumor invasion for these cases.",
