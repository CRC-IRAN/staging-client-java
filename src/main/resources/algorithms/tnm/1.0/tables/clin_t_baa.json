AIN II III or AIN III is reportable to standard-setters (except the Commission on Cancer).  If your registry collects any of these, assign Tis.\n\n**Note 2:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size.\n\n    Invasive tumor confined to mucosa, NOS (including intramucosal, NOS)\n\n    Invades: \n       Lamina propria\n       Muscularis mucosae\n       Submucosa (superficial invasion)\n       Muscularis propria (internal sphincter)\n\n    Localized, NOS\n\n    Ischiorectal fat/tissue\n    Perianal skin\n    Perirectal skin\n    Rectal mucosa or submucosa\n    Rectal wall\n    Skeletal muscle(s):\n        Anal sphincter (external)\n        Levator ani\n    Subcutaneous perianal tissue\n\n**Note 3:**  Code incidental finding of malignancy in hemorrhoid according to greatest extension of tumor into wall of anus.  Assign T1 for localized, NOS if extension not specified.\n\n**Note 4:**  Assign T4 for contiguous extension from the site of origin. Discontinuous involvement is assigned in distant metastasis.",
