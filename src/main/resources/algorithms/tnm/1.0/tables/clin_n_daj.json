  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes such as cervical (excluding supraclavicular) or contralateral axillary and/or internal mammary are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 2:** Clinically detected is defined as detected by clinical examination or by imaging studies (excluding lymphoscintigraphy) and having characteristics highly suspicious for malignancy or a presumed pathologic macrometastasis based on fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytological examination.\n\n**Note 3:** Excisional biopsy of a lymph node or biopsy of a sentinel node, in the absence of assignment of a pT, is classified as a clinical N, e.g., cN1. Pathologic classification (pN) is used for excision or sentinel lymph node biopsy only in conjunction with a pathologic T assignment. \n\n**Note 4:** The breast lymphatics drain by way of three major routes: axillary, transpectoral, and internal mammary. Internal mammary lymph nodes reside within breast tissue and are coded as axillary lymph nodes for staging purposes. Supraclavicular lymph nodes are classified as regional lymph nodes for staging purposes. \n\n**Regional lymph nodes:**\n\n**Axillary (ipsilateral):** interpectoral Rotter nodes and lymph nodes along the axillary vein and its tributaries, which may be divided into the following levels: \n\n        Level I (low-axilla): lymph nodes lateral to the lateral border of  pectoralis minor muscle\n        Level II (mid-axilla): lymph nodes between the medial and lateral borders of the pectoralis minor muscle and the interpectoral (Rotter's) lymph nodes\n        Level III (apical axilla): lymph nodes medial to the medial margin of the pectoralis minor muscle and the inferior to the clavicle. \n        Level III axillary nodes also include infraclavicular (subclavicular) nodes.\n         The infraclavicular designation may be used for level III nodes to differentiate these nodes from the remaining level I and II axillary nodes\n   \n**Internal mammary (ipsilateral)** \n\n    Lymph nodes in the intercostal spaces along the end of the sternum in the endothoracic fascia.\n\n**Supraclavicular (ipsilateral)** \n\n    Lymph nodes in the supraclavicular fossa, a triangle defined by the omohyoid muscle and tendon (lateral and superior border). \n    \n**Intrammary:** \n\n     Lymph nodes within the breast. Intrammary lymph nodes are coded as axillary lymph nodes level I. \n\n**Note 5:**  In a physical exam if palpable nodes are not described as fixed or matted, assume that nodes are movable.",
