  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  TNM does not include an in situ category for carcinoid tumors of appendix.  Assign TX and behavior code /2 for in situ cases.\n\n**Note 2:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1, T2 or T3. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T (sub)category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2 or T3 (sub)categories, but no size or (sub)category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 3:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2 or T3) based on the tumor size.\n\n    Invasive tumor confined to:\n        Lamina propria\n        Mucosa, NOS (including intramucosal, NOS)\n        Muscularis mucosae\n        Muscularis propria \n        Submucosa (superficial invasion)\n\n    Extension through wall, NOS\n    Invasion through muscularis propria or muscularis, NOS\n    Non-peritonealized pericolic tissues invaded\n    Perimuscular tissue invaded\n    Subserosal tissue/(sub)serosal fat invaded\n    Transmural, NOS\n\n    Extension to:\n        Adjacent tissue(s), NOS\n        Connective tissue\n\n    Confined to appendix\n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 4:**  Assign T3 or T4 as appropriate for contiguous extension from the site of origin. Discontinuous involvement is assigned in distant metastasis. \n\n**Note 5:**  Tumor that is adherent to other organs or structures, macroscopically, is classified T4b. However, if no tumor is present in the adhesion, microscopically, the classification should be pT1, pT2 or pT3.",
