For example, if a punch biopsy with involvement of Clark level IV (T1b) is followed by a re-excision with residual tumor involving Clark level II (T1a), assign the Clark level IV (T1b).\n\n**Note 3:**  Satellite lesions/nodules or in-transit metastases are coded in regional lymph nodes.\n\n**Note 4:**  Ulceration of the melanoma is coded in Site-Specific Factor 2.",
