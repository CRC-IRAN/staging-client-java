  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Over 90% of penile cancers are squamous cell carcinomas arising in the skin.  Other cancers arising in the skin include adenocarcinomas (5%) arising in sweat glands, melanomas (2%, included in the Melanoma schema), and basal cell carcinoma (2%).  About 1% of penile cancers are sarcomas, arising in subcutaneous connective tissues.\n\n**Note 2:**  Verrucous carcinoma (M-8051) is a locally aggressive, exophytic, low grade carcinoma with minimal metastatic potential. \n\n**Note 3:** If verrucous carcinoma is described as noninvasive or as having a broad pushing border or penetration, assign code 050. If verrucous carcinoma is not so characterized, assign code 070, Verrucous carcinoma, NOS. If there is destructive invasion of verrucous carcinoma into structures in code 100 or greater, assign the appropriate higher code.\n\n**Note 4:**  Information about involvement of the corpus spongiosum or corpus cavernosum is collected in this field for anatomic staging.  This information is also collected in CS Site-Specific Factor 10 because involvement of these structures may have an independent effect on prognosis.",
