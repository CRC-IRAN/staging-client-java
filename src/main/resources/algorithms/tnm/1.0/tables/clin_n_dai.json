  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:**  If at mediastinoscopy/x-ray, the description is \"mass\", \"adenopathy\", or \"enlargement\" of any of the lymph nodes named as regional lymph nodes in N1 or N2, assume that at least regional lymph nodes are involved. If there is any mention of bilateral or contralateral mass, adenopathy or lymph node involvement , assign N3.\n\n**Note 3:**  The words \"no evidence of spread\" or \"remaining examination negative\" are sufficient information to consider regional lymph nodes negative in the absence of any statement about nodes.\n\n**Note 4:**  Vocal cord paralysis (resulting from involvement of the recurrent branch of the vagus nerve), superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction, or compression of the trachea or the esophagus, may be related to direct extension of the primary tumor or to lymph node involvement.  The treatment options and prognosis associated with these manifestations of disease extent fall within the T4-Stage IIIB category; therefore, generally assign T4 for these manifestations and not regional lymph nodes. However, if the primary tumor is peripheral and clearly unrelated to vocal cord paralysis, SVC obstruction, or compression of the trachea or the esophagus, assign N2 for mediastinal lymph node involvement, unless there is a statement of involvement by direct extension from the primary tumor.",
