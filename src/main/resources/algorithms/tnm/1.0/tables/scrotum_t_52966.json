  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The assignment of the T1 category for cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas with one or no high-risk features is based on tumor size.  A physician's statement of the T1 category may be used to code both tumor size and/or primary tumor if this is the only information in the medical record regarding one or both of these fields. The two fields are coded separately though. If there are no high risk features and tumor size is unknown, assign TX. \n\n**Note 2:**  TNM 7th Edition T1 and T2 categories are based on size and high risk features and not depth of invasion or extension. TNM includes a T3 category for head and neck skin primaries only.\n\n**Note 3:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category (T1 or T2) based on the tumor size.\n\n    Adjacent connective tissue excluding skeletal muscle\n    Confined to scrotum\n    Skeletal muscle\n    Subcutaneous tissue\n    Underlying cartilage\n\n    Adjacent organs/structures:\n        Male genital organs:\n            Epididymis\n            Penis\n            Prostate\n            Spermatic cord\n            Testis\n    Further contiguous extension:\n    Other organs and structures in male pelvis:\n        Bladder\n        Rectum\n        Urethra\n\n    Confined to scrotum, NOS    \n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 4:**  In the case of multiple simultaneous tumors, code the tumor with the greatest extension.\n\n**Note 5:**  Skin ulceration does not alter the T category.",
