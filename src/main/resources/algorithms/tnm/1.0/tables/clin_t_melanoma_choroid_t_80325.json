  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Uveal melanomas arise most commonly in the choroid, less frequently in the ciliary body, and least often in the iris.  Melanomas of the iris tend to be small, and those arising from or extending to the ciliary body typically are large.\n\n**Note 2:**  TNM does not include an in situ category for choroid tumors. Assign 88 and behavior code /2 for in situ tumors.\n\n**Note 3:**  UICC 7th Edition assigns a T value to combinations of measurements for basal diameter and thickness of tumor divided into four Tumor Size Categories in a charted format.  \n\n**Note 4:**  According to UICC , \"In clinical practice the largest tumor basal diameter may be estimated in optic disc diameters (dd, average: 1 dd = 1.5mm). Tumor thickness may be estimated in diopters (average: 2.5 diopters = 1 mm).  However ,techniques such as ultrasonography and fundus photography are used to provide more accurate measurements. Ciliary body involvement can be evaluated by the slit-lamp, opthalmoscopy, gonioscopy and transillumination. HOwver, high frequency ultrasonography (ultrasound biomicroscopy) is used for more accurate assessment. Extension through the sclera is evaluated visually before and during surgery, and with ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.\" \n\n**Note 5:** When histopathological measurements are recorded after fixation, tumor diameter and thickness may be underestimated because of tissue shrinkage.",
