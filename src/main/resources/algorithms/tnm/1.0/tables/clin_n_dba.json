For the lower third of vagina, iliac (common, external, internal (hypogastric), and NOS), and pelvic, NOS lymph nodes are coded in distant metastasis.  For the upper two thirds of vagina, inguinal and femoral lymph nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:**  When both the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique (FIGO) stage and regional lymph node detail are available, record the code with regional lymph node detail in preference to a statement of FIGO stage. FIGO Stage III is assigned based on tumor extension and/or regional lymph node involvement.  Code regional lymph nodes based on a physician's statement of FIGO Stage III based on regional lymph node involvement or if the basis is not stated.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes:**\n\n    Upper two thirds of vagina, regional nodes: \n       Pelvic lymph nodes:\n           Iliac, NOS:\n              Common\n              External\n               Internal (hypogastric)\n                   Obturator\n                   Middle sacral (promontorial) (Gerota's node)\n       Pelvic lymph node(s), NOS\n\n    Lower third of vagina, regional nodes:\n       Ipsilateral or bilateral:\n          Inguinal, NOS:\n             Superficial inguinal (femoral)",
