  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:**  Bilateral nodes are considered regional nodes for tumors with bidirectional drainage to primary nodal basins, as shown on lymphoscintigraphy.  Clinical assessment of bilateral regional nodal involvement is required for tumors where lymphoscintigraphy is not performed.\n\n**Note 3:**  Contiguous or secondary nodal basins are the next nodal drainage basins beyond the primary nodal basins.  Secondary basins are considered regional for TNM staging.\n\n**Note 4:** Regional lymph nodes for vulva\n\n    Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) only\n    Regional lymph nodes (unilateral or bilateral):\n        External iliac\n        Inguinal, NOS:\n            Deep inguinal, NOS:\n            Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n            Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n         Internal iliac (hypogastric)\n         Obturator\n        Pelvic nodes in contiguous or secondary nodal basin \n        Pelvic, NOS\n\n**Note 4:**  In transit metastasis is defined as a tumor distinct from the primary lesion and located either between the primary lesion and the draining regional lymph nodes or distal to the primary lesion. In transit metastasis is coded in regional lymph nodes. \n\n**Note 5:**  Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) should be considered positive nodes. If only ITCs are present, defined as any tumor deposits in lymph nodes less than or equal to 0.2 mm, use code 010.",
