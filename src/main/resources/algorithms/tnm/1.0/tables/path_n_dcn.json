  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  The description of lymph nodes has been standardized across the head and neck schemas.  All lymph node levels and groups listed here are assigned as regional nodes for TNM staging.\n\n**Note 2:**  If laterality of lymph nodes is not specified, assume nodes are ipsilateral.  Midline nodes are assigned as ipsilateral.\n\n**Note 3:** Size of lymph nodes must be known to assign N. You may use a physicianâs statement of the N category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the size of the lymph node(s) is not known, assign N1. \n\n**Note 4:**  For nasopharynx, unilateral and bilateral retropharyngeal nodes are mapped to N1, and nodes in the supraclavicular fossa are mapped to N3b.  The supraclavicular fossa is defined by 3 points: the superior margin of the sterna end of the clavicle, the superior margin of the lateral end of the clavical, and the point where the neck meets the shoulder.\n\n**Note 5:**  For head and neck schemas, this field includes all lymph nodes defined as Levels I-VII and Other by TNM.  \n\n  **Level I:**\n \n    Level IA - Submental\n    Level IB - Submandibular (submaxillary), sublingual\n**Level II - Upper jugular:** \n\n    Jugulodigastric (subdigastric)\n    Upper deep cervical        \n    Level IIA - Anterior\n    Level IIB - Posterior    \n**Level III - Middle jugular:**\n\n    Middle deep cervical\n**Level IV - Lower jugular:**\n\n    Jugulo-omohyoid (supraomohyoid)\n    Lower deep cervical        \n    Virchow node\n**Level V - Posterior triangle group:**\n\n    Posterior cervical\n    Level VA - Spinal accessory        \n    Level VB - Transverse cervical, supraclavicular \n**Level VI - Anterior compartment group:**\n\n    Laterotracheal\n    Paralaryngeal\n    Paratracheal - above suprasternal notch\n    Perithyroidal\n    Precricoid (Delphian)\n    Prelaryngeal\n    Pretracheal - above suprasternal notch\n    Recurrent laryngeal\n**Level VII - Superior mediastinal group (for other mediastinal nodes see M [distant metastasis]):**\n\n    Esophageal groove\n    Paratracheal - below suprasternal notch\n    Pretracheal - below suprasternal notch    \n**Other groups:**\n\n    Cervical, NOS\n    Deep cervical, NOS\n    Facial:\n       Buccinator (buccal)\n       Mandibular\n       Nasolabial\n    Internal jugular, NOS\n    Parapharyngeal \n    Parotid:\n       Infraauricular\n       Intraparotid\n       Periparotid\n       Preauricular\n    Retroauricular (mastoid)\n    Retropharyngeal\n    Suboccipital\n\n    Regional lymph nodes, NOS\n    Lymph nodes, NOS\n\n**Note 6:**  For head and neck schemas, additional information about lymph nodes (size of involved nodes, extracapsular extension, levels involved, and location of involved nodes above or below the lower border of the cricoid cartilage) is coded in **Site-Specific Factors 1, 3-9**.\n\n**Note 7:**  For head and neck cancers, if lymph nodes are described only as \"supraclavicular\", try to determine if they are in Level IV (deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, in the lower jugular chain) or Level V (in the posterior triangle, inferior to the transverse cervical artery) and code appropriately.  \n* If the specific level cannot be determined, assign them as Level V nodes.",
