You may use a physicianâs statement of the N category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the size of the lymph node(s) is not known, assign N1. \n\n**Note 3:** UICC only has a N2, while AJCC has N2a, N2b, and N2c. If a record comes in with N2a, N2b, or N2c, reassign it to N2. N2 and the subcategories of N2 all stage the same way.\n\n**Note 4:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate N category based on size of the lymph node metastasis.\n\n    Iliac, NOS:\n        External\n        Internal (hypogastric), NOS:\n            Obturator\n    Inguinal, NOS:\n         Deep inguinal, NOS:\n             Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n         Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n    Regional lymph node, NOS\n    Lymph nodes, NOS",
