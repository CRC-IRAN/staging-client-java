N2 and the subcategories of N2 all stage the same way.\n\n**Note 3**: Size of the largest metastasis in a lymph node must be known to assign N. You may use a physicianâs statement of the N category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the size of the metastasis is not documented, determine the size of the largest involved lymph node as documented clinically.\n* If the size of the lymph node(s) cannot be determined, assign N1.\n* Do not code the size of any node(s) assigned in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Regional lymph nodes**\n\n    Iliac, NOS:\n        External\n        Internal (hypogastric), NOS:\n            Obturator\n    Inguinal, NOS:\n         Deep inguinal, NOS:\n             Node of Cloquet or Rosenmuller (highest deep inguinal)\n         Superficial inguinal (femoral)\n\n    Regional lymph node, NOS\n    Lymph nodes, NOS",
