  "notes" : "**Note 1:** TNM does not include an in situ category for GIST tumors. Assign TX and behavior code /2 for in situ cases.\n\n**Note 2:**  Give priority to coding depth of invasion or spread outside the small intestine for tumor with intraluminal or lateral extension to adjacent segment(s) of small intestine.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a T value. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If no tumor size is available, assign TX.\n\n**Note 4:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size.\n\n    Invasion of polyp, NOS\n    Tumor confined to muscular wall\n    Tumor invades through submucosa and muscularis mucosae to involve mucosa\n    Intraluminal spread to other segments of small intestine or cecum\n    Invasion through muscularis propria or muscularis, NOS\n    Extension through wall, NOS\n    Subserosal tissue/(sub) serosal fat invaded\n    Transmural, NOS\n\n    Adjacent connective tissue\n    Mesentery, including mesenteric fat, invaded less than or equal to 2 cm in depth or invaded, NOS\n    Nonperitonealized perimuscular tissue invaded less than or equal to 2 cm in depth or invaded, NOS\n    Retroperitoneum invaded less than or equal to 2 cm in depth or NOS\n    Fat, NOS\n    Invasion of/through serosa (mesothelium) (tunica serosa) (visceral peritoneum)\n\n**Duodenum primaries only (C17.0)**\n\n    Ampulla of Vater\n    Blood vessel(s), major:\n        Aorta\n        Gastroduodenal artery\n        Greater omentum\n        Portal vein\n        Renal vein\n        Superior mesenteric artery or vein\n        Vena cava\n    Diaphragm\n    Extrahepatic bile duct(s)\n    Gallbladder\n    Hepatic flexure\n    Kidney, NOS\n    Kidney, right\n    Liver, NOS\n    Liver, quadrate lobe\n    Liver, right lobe\n    Omentum, NOS\n    Pancreas\n    Pancreatic duct\n    Stomach\n    Transverse colon\n    Ureter, right\n\n**Jejunum (C17.1) or Ileum (C17.2) primaries only:** \n\n    Bladder\n    Colon, including appendix\n    Fallopian tube(s)\n    Ovary(ies)\n    Uterus\n\n**For all sites:** \n\n    Abdominal wall\n    Mesentery invaded greater than 2 cm in depth\n    Non-peritonealized perimuscular tissue invaded greater than 2 cm in depth\n    Retroperitoneum invaded greater than 2 cm in depth\n    Other segments of the small intestine via serosa\n\n    Further contiguous extension\n\n    Confined to small intestine\n    Localized, NOS",
