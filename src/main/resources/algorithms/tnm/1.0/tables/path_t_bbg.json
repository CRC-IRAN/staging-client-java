Peritoneal implants may also be called seeding, salting, talcum powder appearance, or studding. \n\n**Note 3:**  If implants are mentioned, determine whether they are in the pelvis or in the abdomen and code appropriately to regional by direct extension or to distant.  In not stated, code to distant.   \n\n**Note 4:**  Since \"cancer cells in ascites or in peritoneal washings\" was not specifically categorized in the 1977 Summary Staging Guide, it is unclear to which stage previous cases may have been coded.",
