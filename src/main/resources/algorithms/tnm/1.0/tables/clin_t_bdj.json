Trabecular, cancellous, or spongy bone (spongiosa) is a porous network of tissue filling the interior of bone, decreasing weight and allowing room for blood vessels and marrow.\n\n**Note 2:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size when involvement is limited to the cortical bone. Involvement through cortical bone is required for assignment of T4a. \n\n    Invasive tumor confined to:\n        Labial mucosa (inner lip)\n        Lamina propria\n        Multiple foci\n        Submucosa (superficial invasion)\n        Vermilion surface\n    Superficial extension to:\n        Skin of lip\n        Subcutaneous soft tissue of lip\n\n    Extension to: \n         Bone, NOS\n         Buccal mucosa (inner cheek)\n         Commissure \n         Cortical bone, NOS\n         Cortical bone of mandible\n         Cortical bone of maxilla \n         Gingiva\n         Mandible, NOS\n         Maxilla, NOS \n         Musculature\n         Opposite lip (both lips)\n   \n    Localized, NOS",
