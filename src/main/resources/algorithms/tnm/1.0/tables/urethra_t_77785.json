  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  In case of multifocal noninvasive Ta and Tis tumors, assign Tis. \n\n**Note 2:**  If assigned Tis, then Behavior code ICD-O-3 must be /2.\n\n**Note 3:**  The presence of muscle around the urethra varies between males and females and, in males, varies among the segments of the urethra. The outer muscular coat (muscularis) is absent in most of the male urethra except for the membranous portion. In females, the muscle coat is continuous from the bladder wall. In addition, in both males and females, there is sphincteric muscle, which may be smooth or skeletal muscle. Invasion of periurethral muscle is assigned T1, unless it is specified as invasion of sphincter muscle, which is assigned T2. Invasion of muscle at the neck of the bladder is assigned T3. If the only information is \"invasion of muscle\", NOS, or \"invasion of periurethral muscle\", NOS, assign T1.",
