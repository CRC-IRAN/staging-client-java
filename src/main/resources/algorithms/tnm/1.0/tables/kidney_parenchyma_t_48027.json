  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Assign 88 for in situ cases (behavior code /2). TNM does not include an in situ category for kidney parenchyma tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  Gerota fascia is a fibrous tissue sheath surrounding the kidney and suprarenal or adrenal gland.  The perirenal fat, renal capsule, and renal parenchyma lie below the fascia.\n\n**Note 3:**  The parenchyma of the kidney includes the following structures: cortex (outer layer of kidney), renal columns; medulla, medullary rays, renal pyramids, and renal papillae; nephrons (renal corpuscle, loops of Henle, proximal and distal tubules, collecting duct); glomerulus and surrounding Bowman's capsule.  The most common site for renal parenchymal cancer to develop is in the proximal convoluted tubule. Tumor extension from one of these structures into another is assigned T1a - T2b depending on size in the absence of further involvement.\n\n**Note 4:** Tumor size must be known to assign a value of T1 or T2. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T (sub)category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 (sub)categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 5:**  For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T (sub)category (T1 or T2) based on the tumor size.\n\n    Invasive cancer confined to kidney cortex and/or medulla\n\n    Invasion of renal capsule\n    Renal pelvis or calyces involved\n    Separate focus of tumor in renal pelvis/calyx\n\n    Confined to kidney\n    Localized, NOS\n\n**Note 6:**  Information about invasion beyond the capsule, venous involvement, and ipsilateral adrenal gland involvement is collected in this field for anatomic staging.  This information is also collected in Site-Specific Factor 1, Site-Specific Factor 2, and Site-Specific Factor 3, as these factors may have an independent effect on prognosis.\n\n**Note 7:**  Direct extension to or involvement of other structures is considered distant metastasis in TNM staging is coded in the M field and not T. This includes: contralateral kidney; contralateral ureter; liver from left kidney; spleen from right kidney.",
