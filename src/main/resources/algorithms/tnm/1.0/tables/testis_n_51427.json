  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Involvement of inguinal, pelvic, or external iliac lymph nodes  **WITHOUT** previous scrotal or inguinal surgery prior to presentation of the testis tumor is coded in M (distant metastasis), as distant lymph node involvement.\n\n**Note 2:** Determine the size of the largest metastasis in a lymph node as documented in the pathology report to assign N, **not** the size of the lymph node. If the size of the metastasis is not documented, determine the size of the largest involved lymph node as documented pathologically or clinically with pathology taking priority. Do **not** code the size of any node(s) coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 3:** Size of lymph nodes must be known to assign N.
