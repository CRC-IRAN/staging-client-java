Distant nodes are coded in metastasis.\n\n**Note 3:**  Superior and inferior mesenteric nodes are coded in distant metastasis.  Mesenteric nodes, NOS are coded in regional lymph nodes.\n\n**Note 4:**  Assign N1 if regional lymph nodes are involved but there is no indication of the number of nodes involved.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes for appendix:**\n\n    Celiac\n        Anterior (prececal)\n        Ileocolic\n        Posterior (retrocecal)\n        Right colic\n    Colic, NOS\n    Epicolic (adjacent to bowel wall)\n    Mesenteric, NOS\n    Mesocolic, NOS\n    Paracolic/pericolic\n\n    Regional lymph nodes, NOS\n    Lymph nodes, NOS",
