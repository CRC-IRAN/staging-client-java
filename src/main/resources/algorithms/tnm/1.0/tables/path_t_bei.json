Tis and TX are mapped to NA and TNM stage group is derived as NA.\n\n**Note 2:**  TNM does not include a T1 or T2 category for mucosal melanoma of head and neck sites.\n\n**Note 3:**  Assign T3 for extension involving the mucosa only of adjacent sites.  Assign T4a or T4b for extension involving the deeper tissues of the primary or adjacent sites.\n\n**Note 4:**  Assign T3 for localized tumor when no other information is available.\n\n**Note 5:**  The bones of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity include the maxilla, the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone, the medial pterygoid plate, the labyrinth and inferior concha of the ethmoid. The roof of the nasal cavity is formed by the nasal bone. The floor of the nasal cavity, which forms the roof of the mouth, is composed of the bones of the hard palate: the horizontal plate of the palatine bone posteriorly and the palatine process of the maxilla anteriorly.\n\n**Note 6:**  \"Bony invasion\" does not include extension to palate, cribriform plate, or pterygoid plates.  Extension to these structures is coded separately.",
