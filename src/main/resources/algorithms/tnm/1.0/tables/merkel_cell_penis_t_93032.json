You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If the tumor appears to be in the T1, T2 or T3 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 5:**   For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2, or T3) based on the tumor size.\n\n    Lesion(s) confined to dermis\n    Invasive tumor limited to skin of penis, prepuce (foreskin), and/or glans\n    Invasive tumor limited to subepithelial connective tissue but not involving corpus spongiosum or corpus cavernosum\n    Subcutaneous tissue (through entire dermis)\n\n    Corpus cavernosum\n    Corpus spongiosum\n    Tunica albuginea\n\n    Localized, NOS",
