  "notes" : "**Note 1:** TNM does not include an in situ category for carcinoid tumors of appendix. Assign TX and behavior code /2 for in situ cases.\n\n**Note 2:**  Ignore intraluminal extension to adjacent segment(s) of colon; code depth of invasion or extra-appendiceal spread as indicated.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a T value. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If no tumor size is available, assign TX.\n\n**Note 4:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size.\n\n    Invasive tumor in polyp, NOS\n    Tumor confined to muscular wall\n    Tumor invades through submucosa and muscularis mucosae to involve mucosa\n\n    Extension through wall, NOS\n    Invasion through muscularis propria or muscularis, NOS\n    Non-peritonealized pericolic tissues invaded\n    Perimuscular tissue invaded\n    Subserosal tissue/(sub)serosal fat invaded\n    Transmural, NOS\n    Wall, NOS\n\n    Extension to:\n       Adjacent tissue(s), NOS\n       Connective tissue\n       Mesenteric fat\n       Mesentery \n       Mesoappendix\n       Pericolic fat\n\n    Fat, NOS\n    Invasion of/through serosa (mesothelium) (visceral peritoneum)\n    Invasion of/through serosa with invasion of/through mucosa\n  \n    Adherent to other organs or structures, NOS\n       Abdominal\n       Adrenal (suprarenal) gland\n       Bladder\n       Diaphragm\n       Fallopian tube\n       Fistula to skin\n       Gallbladder\n       Greater omentum\n       Liver capsule\n       Other segment(s) of colon via serosa\n       Ovary\n       Retroperitoneum (excluding fat)\n       Small intestine\n       Uterus\n\n    Other contiguous extension including:    \n        Kidney\n        Liver\n        Ureter\n\n    Confined to appendix\n    Localized, NOS",
