  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Histological examination of a regional lymphadenectomy specimen will ordinarily include 10 or more lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes are negative, but the number ordinarily examined is not met, classify as pN0. (1)\n\n**Note 2:**  Code only regional nodes and nodes, NOS, in this field.  Distant nodes are coded in M (distant metastasis).\n\n**Note 3:**  Pericholedochal (nodes of the common bile duct), superior mesenteric, and pyloric nodes are classified as distant for TNM 7th staging.  They are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 4:** Porta hepatic nodes are considered distant for Body and Tail and should be coded in distant metastasis.  If the specific location for hepatic nodes is not described, assign N1.\n\n**Regional lymph nodes:**\n\n    Celiac\n    Hepatic\n    Lateral aortic (lumbar)\n    Pancreaticosplenic (pancreaticolienal)\n    Peripancreatic, NOS:\n        Anterior, NOS:\n            Anterior pancreaticoduodenal\n            Anterior proximal mesenteric\n            Inferior to the head and body of pancreas\n        Posterior, NOS:\n            Posterior pancreaticoduodenal\n            Posterior proximal mesentery\n        Superior to the head and body of pancreas\n    Retroperitoneal\n    Splenic (lienal):\n        Gastroepiploic (gastro-omental), left\n        Splenic artery\n        Splenic hilum\n        Suprapancreatic",
