  "notes" : "**Note 1:** TNM does not include an in situ category for GIST tumors. Assign 88 and behavior code /2 for in situ tumors.\n\n**Note 2:**  Give priority to coding depth of invasion or spread outside the small intestine for tumor with intraluminal or lateral extension to adjacent segment(s) of small intestine.\n\n**Note 3:** Tumor size must be known to assign a T value. You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record. If no tumor size is available, assign TX.\n\n**Note 4:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size.\n\n    Invasion of polyp, NOS\n    Tumor confined to muscular wall\n    Tumor invades through submucosa and muscularis mucosae to involve mucosa\n    Intraluminal spread to other segments of small intestine or cecum\n    Invasion through muscularis propria or muscularis, NOS\n    Extension through wall, NOS\n    Subserosal tissue/(sub) serosal fat invaded\n    Transmural, NOS\n\n    Adjacent connective tissue\n    Mesentery, including mesenteric fat\n    Nonperitonealized perimuscular tissue \n    Retroperitoneum \n    Invasion of/through serosa (mesothelium) (tunica serosa) (visceral peritoneum)\n\n**Duodenum primaries only (C170)**\n\n    Ampulla of Vater\n    Blood vessel(s), major:\n        Aorta\n        Gastroduodenal artery\n        Greater omentum\n        Portal vein\n        Renal vein\n        Superior mesenteric artery or vein\n        Vena cava\n    Diaphragm\n    Extrahepatic bile duct(s)\n    Gallbladder\n    Hepatic flexure\n    Kidney (right or NOS)\n    Liver (quadrate lobe, right lobe or NOS)\n    Omentum\n    Pancreas\n    Pancreatic duct\n    Stomach\n    Transverse colon\n    Ureter, right\n\n**Jejunum (C171) or Ileum (C172) primaries only:** \n\n    Bladder\n    Colon, including appendix\n    Fallopian tube(s)\n    Ovary(ies)\n    Uterus\n   \n    Confined to small intestine\n    Localized, NOS",
