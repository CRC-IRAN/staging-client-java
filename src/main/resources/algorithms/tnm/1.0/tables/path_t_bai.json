  "notes" : "**Note 1:** Periosteum is a fibrous membrane that wraps the outer surface of bones. Cortical bone is the dense compact outer layer of the bone. Trabecular, cancellous, or spongy bone (spongiosa) is a porous network of tissue filling the interior of bone, decreasing weight and allowing room for blood vessels and marrow.\n\n**Note 2:** For the following descriptions, assign the appropriate T category based on the tumor size when involvement is limited to the cortical bone. Involvement through cortical bone is required for assignment of T4a. \n\n    Invasive tumor confined to:\n        Lamina propria\n        Submucosa (superficial invasion)\n      \n    Extension to: \n         Bone, NOS\n         Buccal mucosa (inner cheek)\n         Cartilage, NOS\n         Commissure (from lower lip only)\n         Cortical bone, NOS\n         Cortical bone of mandible\n         Cortical bone of maxilla \n         Gingiva \n         Hard palate including cortical palantine bone\n         Lateral pharyngeal wall\n         Lip(s) including commissure\n         Mandible, NOS\n         Maxilla, NOS \n         Musculature (buccinator)\n         Opposite lip (both lips)\n         Soft palate\n         Subcutaneous soft tissue of cheek\n         Tonsillar pillars and fossae\n         Tonsils\n     \n    Localized, NOS",
