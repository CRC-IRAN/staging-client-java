  "notes" : "**Note 1:**  Uveal melanomas arise most commonly in the choroid, less frequently in the ciliary body, and least often in the iris.\n\n**Note 2:**  TNM does not include an in situ category for tumors of the lacrimal gland. Assign TX and behavior code /2 for in situ cases.\n\n**Note 3:**  The TNM 7th Edition assigns a T value to combinations of measurements for basal diameter and thickness of tumor divided into four Tumor Size Categories in a charted format.  \n\n**Note 4:**  According to the TNM, \"In clinical practice the largest tumor basal diameter may be estimated in optic disc diameters (dd) (average: 1 dd = 1.5mm). Tumor thickness may be estimated in diopters (average: 2.5 diopters = 1 mm).  However, techniques, such as ultrasonography and fundus photography are used to provide more accurate measurements.\"",
