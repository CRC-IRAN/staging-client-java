You may use a physicianâs statement of the T category if this is the only information in the medical record.\n* If the tumor appears to be in the T1 or T2 categories, but no size or category is specified, assign TX.\n\n**Note 4:**  Assign the appropriate T category (T1, T2) based on the tumor size for the following descriptions:\n\n    Confined to pancreas\n    Localized, NOS",
