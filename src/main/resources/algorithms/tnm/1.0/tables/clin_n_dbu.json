Distant nodes are coded in distant metastasis.\n\n**Note 2:** Regional nodes include bilateral and contralateral involvement of named nodes.\n\n**Note 3:** Determine the size of the largest metastasis in a lymph node as documented in the pathology report to N, not the size of the lymph node itself. If the size of the metastasis is not documented, determine the size of the largest involved lymph node as documented pathologically or clinically with pathology taking priority. Do not code the size of any node(s) coded in distant metastasis .\n\n**Note 4:**  The assignment of the N category is based both on number and size of metastasis.  Use codes as described here if the number and/or size of nodes involved is unknown:\n\nN1:  Single node involved, size not stated.\nN2:  Multiple nodes involved, size not stated.\nN2:  Single or multiple nodes not stated, size stated and greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm.\nN2:  Single or multiple nodes not stated, size stated and greater than 5 cm.\nN1:  Single or multiple nodes not stated, size not stated.",
